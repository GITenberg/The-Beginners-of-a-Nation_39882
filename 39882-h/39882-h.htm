<h3><i>TO<br>
THE RIGHT HONORABLE JAMES BRYCE, M. P.</i></h3>

<p class="smcap"><i>My dear Mr. Bryce</i>:</p>

<p><i>In giving an account of the origins of the United
States, I have told a story of English achievement. It
is fitting that I should inscribe it to you, who of all the
Englishmen of this generation have rendered the most eminent
service to the American Commonwealth. You have
shown with admirable clearness and candor, and with
marvelous breadth of thought and sympathy, what are the
results in the present time of the English beginnings in
America, and to you, therefore, I offer this volume. I
need not assure you that it gives me great pleasure to
write your name here as godfather to my book, and to
subscribe myself, my dear Mr. Bryce,</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Yours very sincerely,</i></p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii" name="pagevii"></a>(p. vii)</span> PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In this work, brought to completion after many
years of patient research, I have sought to trace from
their source the various and often complex movements
that resulted in the early English settlements in America,
and in the evolution of a great nation with English
speech and traditions. It has been my aim to make
these pages reflect the character of the age in which
the English colonies were begun, and the traits of the
colonists, and to bring into relief the social, political,
intellectual, and religious forces that promoted emigration.
This does not pretend to be the usual account
of all the events attending early colonization; it is
rather a history in which the succession of cause and
effect is the main topic&mdash;a history of the dynamics of
colony-planting in the first half of the seventeenth century.
Who were the beginners of English life in America?
What propulsions sent them for refuge to a wilderness?
What visions beckoned them to undertake
the founding of new states? What manner of men were
their leaders? And what is the story of their hopes,
their experiments, and their disappointments? These
are the questions I have tried to answer.</p>

<p>The founders of the little settlements that had the
unexpected fortune to expand into an empire I have
not been able to treat otherwise than unreverently.
Here are no forefathers or foremothers, but simply English
men and women of the seventeenth century, with
the faults and fanaticisms as well as the virtues of
their age. I have disregarded that convention which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii"></a>(p. viii)</span> makes it obligatory for a writer of American history
to explain that intolerance in the first settlers was not
just like other intolerance, and that their cruelty and injustice
were justifiable under the circumstances. This
walking backward to throw a mantle over the nakedness
of ancestors may be admirable as an example of diluvian
piety, but it is none the less reprehensible in the
writing of history.</p>

<p>While the present work is complete in itself, it is also
part of a larger enterprise, as the half-title indicates.
In January, 1880, I began to make studies for a History
of Life in the United States. For the last sixteen or
seventeen years by far the greater part of my time has
been given to researches on the culture history of the
United States in the period of English domination, that
"good old colony time" about which we have had more
sentiment than information. As year after year was
consumed in this toilsome preparation, the magnitude
of the task became apparent, and I began to feel the
fear for my work so felicitously expressed by Ralegh,
"that the darkness of age and death would have covered
over both it and me before the performance." It
seemed better, therefore, to redeem from the chance of
such mishap a portion of my work, by completing this
most difficult part of the task, in order that when, early
or late, the inevitable night shall fall, the results of my
labor, such as they are, may not be wholly covered over
by the darkness.</p>

<p>There is always difference of opinion in regard to
the comparative fullness with which the several portions
of a historical narrative should be treated, and I can
not hope to escape criticism on this point. I have related
some events with what will be considered disproportionate
amplitude of detail. But the distinctive purpose
of this work is to give an insight into the life and
character of the people, and there are details that make
the reader feel the very spirit and manner of the time.
It is better to let the age disclose itself in action; it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix"></a>(p. ix)</span> is only by ingenious eavesdropping and peeps through
keyholes that we can win this kind of knowledge from
the past. Literary considerations should have some
weight in deciding how fully an episode shall be treated,
unless the historian is content to perform the homely
service of a purveyor of the crude ore of knowledge.
I have sought to make this "a work of art as well as of
historical science," to borrow a phrase from Augustin
Thierry. Some omissions in this volume will be explained
when its successors appear.</p>

<p>I find it an embarrassing task to make acknowledgment
to those who have assisted me; the debts that
have accumulated since I began are too many to be
recorded. I must not neglect to express my grateful
remembrance of the hospitality shown to my researches
during my various sojourns in England. At the British
Museum and at the Public Record Office every facility
has been extended to me, and a similar attention was
shown to my wants at other less public repositories of
books, such as the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel. To Dr. Richard Garnett, the head of the printed
book department of the Museum, I owe thanks for
many personal attentions. I am also indebted to Mr.
E. M. Thompson, keeper of the manuscripts in the museum.
The late Mr. W. Noel Sainsbury, of the Public
Record Office, was very obliging. I owe most of all to
the unfailing kindness of the Right Honorable James
Bryce, M. P., who found time, in the midst of his preoccupations
as a member of Parliament and his duties
in high office, to secure for me access to private stores
of historical material. Lord Edmund Fitzmaurice with
generous kindness put himself to much trouble to facilitate
my examination of the manuscripts at Landsdowne
House. I am indebted to Lord Leconsfield for permission
to visit Petworth House and read there Percy's
Trewe Relacion in the original manuscript. I must ask
others in England who befriended my researches to accept
a general acknowledgment, but I can not forget
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex" name="pagex"></a>(p. x)</span> their courtesy to a stranger. In common with other
students I received polite attentions during my researches
in Paris at the Bibliothèque Nationale.</p>

<p>In this country I owe much to the librarians of public
libraries and their assistants&mdash;too much to allow me
to specify my obligations to individuals. At the Astor,
and at the Lenox, under its more recent management,
my debt has been continual for many years. Acknowledgments
are due to the officers of the Boston Public
Library, the Library of Congress, the Peabody Institute
in Baltimore, and the libraries of the New York, the
Massachusetts, the Pennsylvania, the Maryland, and the
Virginia Historical Societies. To Harvard College Library
and to the New York State Library I am specially
indebted; from them I have been able to supplement
my own collection by borrowing. The Brooklyn Mercantile
Library has granted me similar privileges. The
New York Mercantile Library, on the other hand, I have
not found hospitable to research.</p>

<p>To my generous friend Mr. Justin Winsor I owe
thanks for many favors. Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet
opened his valuable collection to me, and the late Mr.
S. L. M. Barlow showed me similar kindness. My friend,
Mr. Oscar S. Straus, permitted me to use at my own
desk valuable works from his collection. There are
others whose friendly attentions can be more fitly recognized
in later volumes of this series, and yet others
whom I must beg to accept this general but grateful
acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Mr. W. W. Duffield, the Superintendent of the Coast
and Geodetic Survey, supplied the artist with the coast
charts from which the maps in this volume were drawn.</p>

<p>To avoid misapprehension, it is needful to say that
this is not a re-issue of anything I have heretofore
produced. The lectures on the culture history of the
United States given at Columbia College and other institutions
were never written or reported. The papers
on colonial life contributed to the Century Magazine in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexi" name="pagexi"></a>(p. xi)</span> 1882, and the years following, were on a different plan
and scale; they have merely served the purpose of preliminary
studies of the general subject. To the editor
and publishers of the Century Magazine I am obliged
for their courtesy in all affairs relating to my contract
with them, and for an arrangement which enables me to
have free use of my material.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THE FIRST.<br>
<span class="smcap"><i>ENGLISH KNOWLEDGE AND NOTIONS OF AMERICA
AT THE PERIOD OF SETTLEMENT.</i></span></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Elizabethan age.</span> The age of Elizabeth and James&mdash;the age of
Spenser, of Shakespeare, and of Bacon&mdash;was a new
point of departure in the history of the English
race. All the conditions excited men to unwonted
intellectual activity. The art of printing was yet
a modern invention; the New World with its novelties
and unexplained mysteries was a modern
discovery; and there were endless discussions and
agitations of spirit growing out of the recent reformation
in religion. Imagination was powerfully
stimulated by the progress of American exploration,
by the romantic adventures of the Spaniards
in the West Indies, and their dazzling conquest of
new-found empires in Mexico and Peru. It was
an age of creation in poetry, in science, and in religion,
and men of action were everywhere set on
deeds of daring. The world had regained something
of the vigor and spontaneity of youth, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>(p. 2)</span> the credulity and curiosity of youth were not wanting.
The mind of the time accepted and reveled in
marvelous stories. The stage plays of that drama-loving
age reflected the interest in the supernatural
and the eager curiosity about far-away countries.
Books of travel fitted the prevailing taste.
He who could afford to buy them regaled himself
with the great folios of Hakluyt's Voyages and
Purchas his Pilgrimes. General readers delighted
in little tracts and pamphlets relating incidents of
far-away travels, or describing remote countries
and the peoples inhabiting them, or the "monstrous
strange beasts" found in lands beyond the
bounds of Christendom.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Credulity about America.</span> America excited the most lively curiosity as a
world by itself and the least known of all the
"four parts" into which the globe was then divided.
There were those, indeed, who made six
parts of the world by adding an arctic continent,
which included Greenland and a vast southern land
supposed to stretch from Magellan's Strait southward
to the pole. <span class="sidenote">George Beste, First Voyage of Sir Martin Frobisher.</span> It was easy to believe in these
two superfluous continents; they were mirages of
the New World. Every great discovery excites expectation
of others like it. And in a time when
vague report or well-worn tradition counted for
more than observation or experimental knowledge,
it was inevitable that current information about
America should be distorted and mixed with fable.
In that age, still pre-Baconian, men had few standards
by which to measure probabilities, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3"></a>(p. 3)</span> those shut in by the narrow limits of mediæval
knowledge the mere uncovering of a new continent
whose existence contravened the fixed beliefs
of the ages was so marvelous that nothing told
about it afterward seemed incredible.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Illusions of discoverers.</span> The history of American exploration is a story
of delusion and mistake. The New World was
discovered because it lay between Europe and the
East Indian Spice Islands by the westward route.
Columbus, seeking the less, found the greater by
stumbling on it in the dark. Zuan Caboto&mdash;in
English, John Cabot&mdash;who is described by a contemporary
as "a Venetian fellow with a fine mind,
greatly skilled in navigation," discovered North
America in 1497. But he did not exult that he
was the finder of a vast and fertile continent in
which great nations might germinate, for he believed
that his landfall at Cape Breton was within
the dominions of the Grand Cham of China, and
he sailed down the coast again the next year, "ever
with the intent to find said passage to India."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c1_1" name="note_b1_c1_1"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c1_1">Note 1.</a></span> It
was announced on his return from his first voyage
that Henry VII had "won a part of Asia without
a stroke of the sword."</p>

<p>The discovery of the Pacific by Balboa in 1513,
and the voyage of Magellan's ship across that ocean
in 1520, were not sufficient to remove the illusion
that America was connected with Asia. The notion
that the New World was an Asiatic peninsula
died lingeringly about the middle of the sixteenth
century; but to reach Asia was still the main purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>(p. 4)</span> of western exploration, and America was for
a long time regarded mainly as an obstruction.
The belief in a passage to the Pacific by means
of some yet-to-be-discovered strait severing the
continent of America, survived far into the seventeenth
century, and the hope of coming by some
short cut into a rich commerce with the Orient led
to a prying exploration of all the inlets, bays, and
estuaries on the American coast and so promoted
discovery, but it retarded settlement by blinding
men to the value of the New World.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c1_2" name="note_b1_c1_2"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c1_2">Note 2.</a></span></p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Frobisher.</span> Adventure by sea became a favorite road to
renown for ambitious Englishmen in the time of
Elizabeth, and the belief in a passage through or
round North America grew into a superstition.
The discovery of this strait seemed, in the phrase
of George Beste, a writer of the time, "the onely
thing of the world that was left undone whereby
a notable mind might be made famous and fortunate."
Sir Martin Frobisher, who is reckoned by
Camden "among the famousest men of our age for
counsell and glory gotten at sea," made three voyages
in 1576 and the following years to that part
of the American coast almost under the arctic
circle. <span class="sidenote">Frobisher's Voyages, Hakl. Soc., <i>passim</i>.</span> He desisted from the attempt to get to
China by an arctic channel only when he had involved
the "venturers" or stockholders associated
with him in heavy debts, and spent the fortune of
his wife and stepchildren, to whom "glory gotten
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>(p. 5)</span> at sea" must have been insufficient compensation.
"Sir Martin Frobisher whome God forgive" is the
phrase in which he is spoken of by his wife.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gilbert.</span> In the year of Frobisher's first voyage, Sir
Humphrey Gilbert issued a treatise to prove that
there was a way to the East Indies round North
America. This he demonstrated by a hydra-headed
argument constructed after the elaborate
fashion of that unscientific age, proving the existence
of a northwest passage, first by authority,
secondly by reason, thirdly by experience of sundry
men's travels, and fourthly by circumstance.
<span class="sidenote">Voy., 184-227.</span> Not content with getting to China by logic, and
nothing daunted by Frobisher's brilliant failure,
Gilbert mortgaged his estate that he might engage
in attempts yet more disastrous than Frobisher's,
and lost his life during his second voyage, in 1584.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hakluyt.</span> About this time there appeared on the scene
the famous geographer, Richard Hakluyt, one of
those men that exert a marked influence in favor of
a new movement mainly by ardor and industry.
Hakluyt's fervor was akin to enthusiasm, his belief
of every story favorable to projects for colonization,
and his unwavering faith in the projects
themselves bordered on flat credulity. To men of
his own time his tireless advocacy of American exploration
and colony-planting must have seemed
irksome hobby-riding. But he was the indispensable
forerunner of colonization. "Your Mr. Hakluyt
hath served for a very good trumpet," says
Sidney. Believing in everything American as unwaveringly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>(p. 6)</span> as if his soul's salvation depended on
his faith, he believed in nothing more sublimely
than in a passage to the "South Sea" or Pacific
Ocean. He seized on every vague intimation of
ignorant map-makers, on every suspicion of an
explorer, on every fond tale of an Indian that
tended to lend support to the theory in hand. All
evidence was of equal weight in his scales, provided
it lay on the affirmative side of the balance.
It mattered little to him where his witnesses placed
this elusive passage. In Hakluyt's mind it was
ubiquitous. The Pacific is now "on the backside"
of Montreal Island, and the great Laurentian lakes

flowing three months to the southward&mdash;that is,
the Mississippi. Then the much-sought strait is
carried northward on the authority of an old map&mdash;"a
great old round carde"&mdash;shown him "by the
King of Portingall." But he had also seen "a
mightie large old mappe in parchment" which
showed, as far south as latitude 40°, a little neck
of land "much like the streyte neck or Isthmus of
Darienna." <span class="sidenote">Hakl. Disc. on Western Planting.</span> He had seen the same isthmus on another
old map "with the sea joynninge hard on
both sides as it doth on Panama." In a paper
meant for private use, he expresses solicitude that

known too commonly. <span class="sidenote">N. Y. Col. Docs. I, 16.</span> Many years later an

<p><span class="sidenote">Ralegh.</span> Both Frobisher and Gilbert made ineffectual
attempts to plant colonies in the new lands, but
colony-planting held a place in their minds quite
secondary to the search for the South Sea in the
north and the finding of gold. It was only when
the large and lucid mind of Sir Walter Ralegh
took up the subject seriously that the settlement of
an agricultural colony became for a while the real
object of American voyages. Ralegh sent no men
to the arctic or to the wintry shores of Newfoundland,
as Frobisher and Gilbert had done. He
turned to milder latitudes, and dispatched his explorers
in 1584, and his colonists in 1585, to the
coast of what is now North Carolina.</p>

<p>But the ever-mischievous South Sea delusion
did not vanish when the period of colonization was
reached. <span class="sidenote">Ralph Lane's quest.</span> Ralph Lane, the governor of Ralegh's
first colony on Roanoke Island, having inquired
perhaps for that western sea which Hakluyt had
seen "on the mightie old mappe in parchment,"
understood the inventive savages to say that the
Roanoke River sprang from a rock so near to a
sea that the waves in storm often dashed into this
fountain, making the river brackish for some distance
below. That the story might be more interesting,
they added that there was gold there, and
that the walls of a town in that land were made of
pearls. This is what the white men fancied the
Indians said; but whatever they said was spoken in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>(p. 8)</span> a tongue of which Lane's men had but the most
scanty knowledge, if indeed it were not given
mainly by signs.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c1_3" name="note_b1_c1_3"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c1_3">Note 3.</a></span> Nothing dispirited by the extravagance
of these tales, Lane and some of his
men set out to immortalize and enrich themselves&mdash;like
a company of children running after the pot of
gold at the end of the rainbow. <span class="sidenote">Lane's Account in Hakl. III.</span> While the crafty
Indians were plotting the destruction of the colonists
left behind, the governor and his followers
pursued their quest until they were obliged to eat
their dogs, made palatable by seething with a
dressing of sassafras leaves. They returned, half
famished and wholly disappointed, just in time to
rescue the colony from destruction. But faith is
faith, and despite his severe experience Lane went
back to England believing that the Roanoke rose
near to the Bay of Mexico "that openeth out into
the South Sea." The map which the colonists
brought with them when they abandoned the country
in 1586 handed down the delusion, in another
form, by showing a strait leading from the neighborhood
of Port Royal into a body of water to the
westward. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c1_4" name="note_b1_c1_4"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c1_4">Note 4.</a></span></p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Seeking the Pacific on James River.</span> Twenty years after the return of Ralegh's first
colonists the Jamestown company was sent to
plant the germ of an English-speaking nation in
North America. Beginning with the first voyage
of Columbus, the search for a route through America
had lasted a hundred and fourteen years. No
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>(p. 9)</span> passage north of Magellan's Strait had been found,
yet a belief in the existence of such a water-way
remained a part of the geographical creed of the
time. The Jamestown emigrants were officially
instructed to explore that branch of any river
that lay toward the northwest, perhaps because
the charmed latitude of 40° might thus be reached.
It was in carrying out this instruction that Captain
John Smith came to grief at the hands of
the Indians while looking for the Pacific in the
swamps of the Chickahominy. Smith rarely mixed
his abounding romance with his geography; he is
as sober and trustworthy in topographical description
and in map-making as he is imaginative in
narration. But Smith was at this time under the
influence of the prevailing delusion, and he hoped
that his second voyage up the Chesapeake would
lead him into the Pacific. <span class="sidenote">Hudson.</span> His belief in a passage
to the westward in latitude 40°, just beyond
the northward limit of his own explorations,
he communicated to his friend Henry Hudson,
who was so moved by it that he sailed to
America in 1609 in violation of his orders, and in
seeking the strait to the South Sea penetrated the
solitudes of the picturesque river that bears his
name. <span class="sidenote">Dermer.</span> The explorer Dermer was intent on winning
immortality by finding a passage to the Pacific
when, in 1619, he was storm-driven into Long
Island Sound. At Manhattan Island, or thereabout,
he got information from the obliging Indians that
made plain his way to the Orient. He was very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>(p. 10)</span> secretive about this route, which, however, seems
to have lain through Delaware Bay.</p>

<p>A false notion once generally accepted is able
to live in some ghostly shape after the breath is
out of its body. The hope of a passage to the Pacific
by means of a strait and the belief in a narrow
isthmus in latitude 40° could not long survive the
increase of knowledge that followed the settlement
of Virginia and Captain Smith's explorations.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c1_5" name="note_b1_c1_5"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c1_5">Note 5.</a></span> But
sixteen years after the landing at Jamestown, when
these two geographical jack-o'-lanterns had ceased
to flicker, the poet George Sandys, who was secretary
of the colony, wrote that he was ready to
venture his life in finding a way to the South Sea,
but this way was now to be by an overland route. <span class="sidenote">Sandys's plan.</span>
About the same time Henry Briggs, the famous
Savile lecturer at Oxford, proved to the satisfaction
of many that the rivers running westward
from the Virginia mountains must reach the Pacific
in about one hundred and fifty miles.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c1_6" name="note_b1_c1_6"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c1_6">Note 6.</a></span> One Marmaduke
Parkinson, an explorer sailing in the Potomac,
confirmed the theory of the learned mathematician
by discovering in the house of a chief a "China
Boxe," whatever that may have been. <span class="sidenote">Luke Fox.</span> In 1631
Luke Fox set sail by the northwest, carrying a letter
from Charles I addressed "to the Emperor of
Japan," which he probably was not able to deliver. <span class="sidenote">Northwest. Fox, p. 172.</span>
In 1634 Captain Thomas Yong got as far as the
falls of the Delaware in the endeavor to go through
the continent in latitude 40°. The strait and isthmus
and northwest passage having failed, Yong
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>(p. 11)</span> was content to go by fresh water till he should
reach a Mediterranean Sea in the heart of America,
which he believed to open into both the "North
Ocean" and the South Sea. <span class="sidenote">Weston Documents 45 and 47 and ff.</span> As the century advanced
the fresh-water route had in turn to be
finally abandoned, and seekers after the Pacific
were fain to betake themselves to dry-shod travel,
and even to mountain-climbing, as George Sandys
had proposed. <span class="sidenote">Catlet and Lederer.</span> A Colonel Catlet is mentioned who
reached the Alleghanies in the endeavor to find a
river flowing westward, but he was daunted by
what seemed to him almost impassable ranges of
mountains that barred his way. <span class="sidenote">Glover, in Phil. Trans., xi 626. Comp. Perfect Descr.
of Va., 1649 and Lederer's Voyage.</span> Over these "rocky

from Virginia on a similar futile exploration. <span class="sidenote">Lawson's Carolina, 47.</span> As
late as 1700 the well-informed Lawson speaks hopefully
of the proximity of the Pacific to North Carolina.
This fallacy had prompted many desperate
adventures, and had been the cause of many important
discoveries, in the two centuries that it held
possession of men's minds. <span class="sidenote">Scot's Magazine, 1765, page 161.</span> It reached its last attenuation
in 1765, when the public prints announced
that large boats were fitting out at Quebec to try
the whale-fishing in Lake Ontario, and that "they
have hopes of finding a communication by water
with the western ocean, founded on the favorable
reports of some Indians, who inform that a river
runs westward many hundreds of miles as large as
the Mississippi."</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>(p. 12)</span> V.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gold-hunting.</span> As the mistake made by Columbus had left for
heritage an almost ineradicable passion for the discovery
of a westward sea way to Japan and China,
so the vast treasure of gold and silver drawn by
the Spaniards from Mexico and Peru produced a
belief in the English mind that a colony planted at
any place on the American coast might find gold.
Here, again, the undoubting Hakluyt and other
writers after him were ready with learned conclusions
balancing on the tight rope of very slender
premises. If an Indian had been seen wearing a
piece of copper that "bowed easily," this flexibility
proved it to be tarnished gold. If a savage seemed
to say in his idiom, or by gestures and other signs,
something which the puzzled newcomers took to
signify that in a country farther on the copper was
too soft for use, or that it was yellow, or that it
had a good luster, what further evidence could an
ingenious writer desire of the existence of the precious
metal in that country? <span class="sidenote">Hakluyt. Pref. to Va., magnified.</span> Purchas, the successor
of Hakluyt in geographical research, explains
the divine purpose in thus endowing a
heathen land with gold, which is that the Indian
race "as a rich bride, though withered and deformed,
... might find many suitors for love of
her portion," and thus the pagans be converted. <span class="sidenote">Pilgrimage, 795.</span>
But Purchas filches both the simile and the pious
thought from Herrera, who in turn probably pilfered
it with many better things from the good
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>(p. 13)</span> Las Casas. Purchas also speaks with more optimism
than elegance of the "silver bowels and
golden entrails of the hills," as though one had but
to dig into the first mountain to be enriched.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Frobisher's gold.</span> Frobisher brought home from sub-arctic islands
what his clumsy assayers avouched to be "gold
eure." Refining works were erected for this stuff
at Deptford to no profit, and to this day the inquisitive
student is not able to ascertain from the
conflicting reports whether there was any gold in
the ore or not. <span class="sidenote">Early Virginia gold-hunting.</span> The main causes of the suffering
at Jamestown during the first winter were the
waste of time and the consumption of supplies
while lading the ships with the glittering "dust
mica" which is so abundant in the Virginia sands.
The worthlessness of this cargo could not weaken
the hopes of those alchemists who were able to
produce gold merely by the use of arguments. The
mines in Virginia moved farther west. It wanted
only that explorers should reach the mountains. In
spite of the sickness that wasted the colony in 1610,
Lord De la Warr sent an expedition to dig gold
on the upper James, but the warlike up-river tribes
soon drove the prospectors back. In 1634, Sir John
Harvey sent another body of men on the same
fool's errand, though there had not been found in
all the years preceding a particle of tangible evidence
that gold existed in Virginia. But on the
James, as on the Hudson, the glistering pigment
with which the Indians besmeared their faces on
occasions of display was believed to contain gold,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>(p. 14)</span> and the places of its procurement were sought
with ludicrous secrecy.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c1_7" name="note_b1_c1_7"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c1_7">Note 7.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fact and fable about America.</span> The unfaltering faith in the existence of abundant
gold on the eastern coast of North America
could not have subsisted on thin air so long if it
had not been stimulated by the almost fabulous
wealth drawn from South America by Spain. It
had received encouragement also from the tales
told by adventurers returned from America, who
seem to have thought it necessary to bring back
stories that would match in some degree the prevalent
beliefs about the New World. The earliest
but one of all the documents relating to America
preserved among the British state papers is the
statement of one David or Davy Ingram. With a
hundred other luckless seamen he was put ashore
in Mexico by Sir John Hawkins, because the ship
lacked provisions. Ingram, traveling from tribe to
tribe, achieved the notable feat of crossing the continent
in a year. In 1569 he embarked on a French
ship that he found near the mouth of the St. John
River in what is now the province of New Brunswick.
It was eleven years later that Davy Ingram,
at home in England, made his statement, and the
sailor's story had by that time gained much, perhaps,
by frequent telling to wonder-loving listeners. <span class="sidenote">Ingram's story.</span>
Sometimes he relates facts with sobriety, speaking
the truth by relapse, it may be; again, he seems to
be repeating tales told him by the savages, who
were habitual marvel-mongers, or weaving into
the account of what he had seen legends common
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>(p. 15)</span> in the folklore about America that had grown
up in Europe; or perchance he only falls into an
old forecastle habit of incontinent lying without
provocation. The American women are described
as "wearing great plates of gold covering their
whole bodies like armor.... In every cottage
pearls are to be found, and in some houses a peck"&mdash;an
assertion that had a grain of truth in it, since
the sailor no doubt mistook wampum beads for
pearls. Fireflies, in this old tar's exalted memory,
are "fire dragons, which make the air very red
as they fly," while the buffalo appears as an animal
"as big as two of our oxen." The streets in one
"city" are broader than London streets, which we
may readily believe. The banqueting houses are
built of crystal, "with pillars of massie silver, some
of gold." This is a fine example of the manner of
a mind afflicted with the vice of exaggeration;
crystal becomes silver in the next breath, and silver
is as instantly transmuted to gold. All that
optimistic projectors sought in America&mdash;gold, silver,
pearls by the peck, and great abundance of
silkworms&mdash;are obligingly supplied in Ingram's
narrative. Such tales impressed the imagination
in a romantic and uncritical age.

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Indian devil-worship.</span> The interest in America was heightened by
popular curiosity regarding the Indians. The
American savages were sometimes treated as sun-worshipers,
but they were more commonly thought
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>(p. 16)</span> to be worshipers of devils. The prevailing belief in
witchcraft, divination, and abounding evil spirits
rendered it easy for Europeans to accept the Indian
deities as supernatural beings, and to credit the pretensions
of the powwows, or Indian priests, to give
knowledge of distant or future events, to heal the
sick, and even to bring rain in time of drought. But
it was observed at Plymouth that when the Pilgrims
prayed for rain it fell gently, and that the rain procured
by the Indian conjurers was violent and destructive&mdash;a
rain with something devilish about it.
According to writers of the time, the demons worshiped
by the savages were able to materialize
themselves on great occasions, appearing to their
votaries in some beastly form. This belief in Indian
devil-worship fitted well with the religious
faith of the period, which can hardly be described
as anything but a sort of Manichæism dividing the
government of the universe almost equally between
good and evil powers. Religionists of all
schools desired to convert these subjects of Satan,
not from those philanthropic motives that are main
considerations in modern propagandism, but because
their conversion would glorify God, and yet
more because it would despite the devil. Sometimes
the religious motive was incongruously supported
by hopes of commercial advantage. The
navigator Davis wrote to Secretary Walsingham
that if the Indians "were once brought over to the
Christian faith they might soon be brought to relish
a more civilized kind of life and be thereby induced
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>(p. 17)</span> to take off great quantities of our coarser
woolen manufactures."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Indians exhibited.</span> The early explorers made a practice of kidnapping
Indians and transporting them to England,
where the sight of barbarians without doublet or
hose quickened the interest in projects for colonization
and adventure. In our age of commercial
activity and extended geographical knowledge one
can form but a weak conception of the excitement
produced by the sight of "the Indian man and
woman," no doubt Esquimaux, brought by Frobisher.
Portraits of these rarities were made for
the king and queen and others. In 1605 Weymouth
brought from the coast of Maine five kidnapped
Indians, "with all their bows and arrows"
and two beautiful birch-bark canoes. <span class="sidenote">Rosier's True Relation.</span> "This accident,"
exclaimed Sir Ferdinando Gorges, "hath
been the means of putting life into all our plantations."
Some of the savages captured at various
times were exhibited for money, and one perhaps
was shown after he was dead; at least we may venture
to conjecture so much from Shakespeare's
jeer in The Tempest at the idle curiosity of the
crowd. In England, says Trinculo, "any strange
beast makes a man. <span class="sidenote">Tempest, ii, 2.</span> When they will not give a
doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten
to see a dead Indian." This interest in outlandish
savages no doubt suggested to the poet the creation
of the monster Caliban, who probably seemed
a realistic figure to the imagination of that age.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>(p. 18)</span> VII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Notions about animals.</span> The animals of the new continent excited the
wonder of the people of Europe and increased the
interest in America. Regarding them, also, the
most extravagant stories were easily credited. It
was recorded in the sober Latin of Peter Martyr
that the advance of Cabot's ships was retarded by
the multitude of codfish on the Newfoundland
coast, and that the bears were accustomed to catch
these fish in their claws.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c1_9" name="note_b1_c1_9"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c1_9">Note 9.</a></span> It is hard to recognize
the familiar opossum in the description by Purchas:
"A monstrous deformed beast, whose fore
part resembleth a fox, the hinder part an ape, excepting
the feet, which are like a man's; beneath
her belly she hath a receptacle like a purse, where
she bestows her young until they can shift for
themselves." The humming bird was believed to
be a cross between a fly and a bird. The Hudson
River Dutch settlers went further, and named it
simply "the West Indian bee." These dainty
creatures were prepared for exportation to Europe
in New Amsterdam by drying them, in Barbadoes
by filling them with sand. <span class="sidenote">Evelyn's Diary, i, 277.</span> They were accounted
"pretty delicacies for ladies, who wore them at
their breasts and girdles." Evelyn saw two preserved
as great rarities at Oxford, in 1564. A New
England versifier extols</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>(p. 19)</span> parks in 1608, were the occasion of much wondering
excitement. King James begged for one of
them, like a spoiled child. The skins of muskrats
were esteemed for their odor and were brought to
England "as rich presents." It was thought that
musk might be extracted from this animal. Hariot,
the learned man of Ralegh's first colony, fancied
that the civet cat would prove profitable to
settlers in America, but his words indicate that he
had been misled by traces of the skunk, whose perfume
has never yet come into request. <span class="sidenote">De Bry's Hariot, p. 10.</span> Speaking
of the "civet catte," he says, "in our travails there
was found one to have been killed by a salvage or
inhabitant; and in many places the smell where
one had lately beene before."</p>

<p>The raccoon, the "aroughcun" of the Virginia
Indians, being a plantigrade, was esteemed a monkey;
the peccaries were called the wild hogs of
America, and were thought to have "their navels
on the ridge of their backs."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c1_10" name="note_b1_c1_10"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c1_10">Note 10.</a></span> Somewhere in the
region of the Hudson River a beast is described as
having a horn in the middle of his forehead, from
which it would appear that the unicorn on the
royal coat of arms may have been found running
at large. It is not easy to account for the "camel
mare," reported to have been seen about three
hundred miles west from the coast of New Jersey,
unless it belonged to the genus <i>Incubus</i>. The bewildering
number of new creatures found in America
troubled the European scholars of that day,
who were ever theological. They were puzzled
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>(p. 20)</span> to get so many four-footed beasts and creeping
things into the compass of Noah's ark. Mercator,
the Flemish geographer, avoided this difficult embarkation
by concluding that America had been
excepted from the Deluge.</p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p>Thus grotesque and misleading were many of
the glimpses that Europe got of the New World
as the mists of ignorance slowly lifted from it.
<span class="sidenote">An age of romance and adventure.</span> These erratic notions regarding America give one
an insight into the character of the English people
at the period of discovery and colony-planting.
Credulity and the romantic spirit dwell together.
The imagination in such an age usurped
the place of discrimination, and the wonderful became
the probable. The appetite for the marvelous
fostered exaggeration; every man who had
sailed in foreign seas thought it shame not to tell
of wonders. The seventeenth century indeed betrayed
a consciousness of its own weakness in a
current proverb, "Travelers lie by license." History
and fiction had not yet been separated. Like
every other romantic age, the period of Elizabeth
and James was prodigal of daring adventure; every
notable man aspired to be the hero of a tale. English
beginnings in America were thus made in a
time abounding in bold enterprises&mdash;enterprises
brilliant in conception, but in the execution of
which there was often a lack of foresight and practical
wisdom.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>(p. 22)</span> It was reproduced to accompany a paper of mine on the Virginia
Colony in the Century Magazine of November, 1882. It
excited interest among scholars, as it was supposed to have been
previously unknown. A copy was afterward found, however, in
the collection made by Dr. Kohl for the State Department at
Washington. The drawings in the Sloane MSS., British Museum,
attributed to John White by Dr. E. E. Hale, in the Transactions
of the American Antiquarian Society, iv, 21, are not White's
originals. The latter are in the Grenville Collection. See my

Company to Governor Wyatt, these words occur: "The Conjectures
of the Southwest Passage and the piece of copper which
you sent us gladly saw and heard." This long-surviving desire
for a short passage to the East Indies is traceable to the passion
that existed in Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries for
spices, and this no doubt came from the gross forms of cookery
in that time. Anderson's Commerce, sub anno 1504, cites Guicciardini
on the great quantities of spices used, and adds: "For in
those days the people of Europe were much fonder of spices in
their cookery, etc., than they have been in later times." The rise
in the price of commodities in Elizabeth's time may have been
only apparent, but it promoted voyages looking to the extension
of commerce. Compare Holinshed, i, 274.</p>

Purchas, iii, 892, 893, where these words are quoted from Briggs:
"The Indian Ocean, which we commonly call the South Sea,
which lyeth on the West and Northwest Side of Virginia, on the
other side of the mountains beyond our Falls [of James River]
and openeth a free and faire passage, not only to China, Japan,
and the Moluccas, but also to New Spaine, Peru, and Chili, and
those rich countries of Terra Australis not as yet discovered." It
is one of many marks of practical sagacity in Captain John Smith
that after his experience on the American coast he was able to
form views of the geography of the continent almost a century in
advance of the opinions held in his time. He speaks of "those
large Dominions which doe stretch themselves into the main
God knoweth how many thousand miles" (Generall Historie,
book vi).</p>

Spelman's party, after spending five years in captivity among the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>(p. 23)</span> Virginia Indians, persuaded a London merchant to intrust him
with a vessel for the Indian trade by his stories of the "powder of
gold" with which the savages made a paint for their faces. To
this story he added a statement that he had often been in sight
of the South Sea or Pacific Ocean. Fleet's Journal may be found
in Scharf's History of Maryland, i, 13, etc. Van der Donck relates,
in his description of New Netherland, that Kieft, the director
of New Netherland, and Van der Donck, found an Indian
painting himself and bought the pigment, which being burned in
a crucible yielded two pieces of gold. (See the translation in
New York Historical Society Collection, ii, 161, 162.) A bag of
specimens of the precious ores of the Hudson River region was
sent to Holland by the ill-fated ship that sailed out of New
Haven in 1645. The ship was seen no more except by the
New Haven people, who beheld its specter in the sky. Of the
Hudson River gold mines no specter has ever been seen in earth
or sky.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b1_c1_8" name="anote_b1_c1_8"></a><a href="#note_b1_c1_8">Note 8, page 15.</a></span> I have quoted from Mr. Sainsbury's abstract of the fragment
in the British Public Record Office, but a similar statement by
Ingram was inserted in Hakluyt's Divers Voyages in 1589. It
was omitted in the later edition as too incredible even for Hakluyt.
See also a paper by Dr. De Costa, in the Magazine of
American History, March, 1883, on the copy of Ingram's Statement
preserved in the Bodleian Library. Ingram's story, and
others like it, seem to be satirized in the play of Eastward, Ho!
by Chapman, Jonson, and Marston. The assertion of Seagull, in
the play, that "they have in their houses scowpes, buckets, and
diverse other vessels of massie silver," would seem at first sight
to be an unmistakable allusion to the extravagance of Ingram's
narrative. But in the second edition of Bullein's A Dialogue
against the Fever Pestilence, which was published in 1573, one
Mendax, describing an unknown land, declares that "their pottes,
panns, and all vessells are cleane gold garnished with diamondes."
This shows that Ingram's story had probably absorbed
certain traits from what I have ventured to call European
folklore tales about America&mdash;folk tales originally applied to the
Orient, no doubt; echoes of Sir John Mandeville and Marco
Polo, perhaps. Of course it is just possible, but not probable,
that Bullein had heard the tales of Ingram, who had returned
three years or more before he printed his second edition. The
authors of Eastward, Ho! probably enlarged on Bullein.</p>

Speed's Prospect, Description of New York. Speed also lets us
know that the buffalo was accustomed to defend himself by vomiting
"a hot scalding liquor" on the dogs that chased it. Argall
was the first Englishman to see the bison, in 1613. Citing his
letter, Purchas says, p. 943, "In one voyage ... they found a
slow kind of cattell as bigge as kine, which were good meate."</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Departure of the emigrants.</span> In December, 1606, there lay at Blackwall,
below London, the Susan Constant, of one hundred
tons, the Godspeed, of forty tons, and the little pinnace
Discovery, of but twenty tons&mdash;three puny
ships to bear across the wintry Atlantic the beginners
of a new nation. The setting forth of these
argonauts produced much excitement in London.
Patriotic feeling was deeply stirred, public prayers
were offered for the success of the expedition, sermons
appropriate to the occasion were preached,
and the popular feeling was expressed in a poem
by Michael Drayton. Even those who were too
sober to indulge the vain expectations of gold
mines and spice islands that filled the imaginations
of most Englishmen on this occasion could say, as
Lord Bacon did later: "It is with the kingdoms on
earth as it is with the kingdom of heaven: sometimes
a grain of mustard seed proves a great tree.
Who can tell?" <span class="sidenote">Ld. Chancellor's Speech in reply to the Speaker.</span> On the 19th of that most tempestuous
December the little fleet weighed anchor
and ran down on an ebb tide, no doubt, as one may
nowadays see ships rush past Blackwall toward the
sea. Never were men engaged in a great enterprise
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>(p. 26)</span> doomed to greater sorrows. <span class="sidenote">A. D. 1606.</span> From the time
they left the Thames the ships were tossed and
delayed by tempests, while the company aboard
was rent by factious dissensions.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The laws and orders.</span> Those who shaped the destinies of the colony
had left little undone that inventive stupidity could
suggest to assure the failure of the enterprise.
King James, who was frivolously fond of puttering
in novel projects, had personally framed a code of
unwise laws and orders. The supremacy of the
sovereign and the interests of the Church were
pedantically guarded, but the colony was left without
any ruler with authority enough to maintain
order. The private interest of the individual, the
most available of all motives to industry, was
merged in that of the commercial company to
which Virginia had been granted. All the produce
of the colony was to go into a common stock
for five years, and the emigrants, men without
families, were thrown into a semi-monastic trading
community like the Hanseatic agencies of the time,
with the saving element of a strong authority left
out. Better devices for promoting indolence and
aggravating the natural proneness to dissension of
men in hard circumstances could scarcely have
been hit upon. Anarchy and despotism are the
inevitable alternatives under such a communistic
arrangement, and each of these ensued in turn.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>(p. 27)</span> III.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Character of the emigrants.</span> The people sent over in the first years were for
the most part utterly unfit. <span class="sidenote">Smith's Gen. Hist., iii, c. i and c. xii.</span> Of the first hundred,
four were carpenters, there was a blacksmith, a
tailor, a barber, a bricklayer, a mason, a drummer.
There were fifty-five who ranked as gentlemen,
and four were boys, while there were but twelve
so-called laborers, including footmen, "that never
did know what a day's work was." <span class="sidenote">Advertisements for Planters of New Eng., p. 5.</span> The company
is described by one of its members as composed of
poor gentlemen, tradesmen, serving men, libertines,
and such like. <span class="sidenote">Comp. Briefe Declaration in Pub. Rec. Off., Sainsbury
i, 66; and New Life of Va.</span> "A hundred good workmen were
better than a thousand such gallants," says Captain
Smith. Of the moral character of the first emigrants
no better account is given. <span class="sidenote">Essay on Plantations.</span> It was perhaps
with these men in view that Bacon declared it "a
shameful and unblessed thing" to settle a colony
with "the scum of the people."</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The arrival.</span> The ships sailed round by the Canaries, after
the fashion of that time, doubling the distance to
Virginia. They loitered in the West Indies to
"refresh themselves" and quarrel, and they did
not reach their destination until seedtime had
well-nigh passed. They arrived on the 6th of
May, according to our style. Driven into Hampton
Roads by a storm, they sailed up the wide
mouth of a river which they called the James, in
honor of the king. <span class="sidenote">A. D. 1607.</span> At that season of the year the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>(p. 28)</span> banks must have shown masses of the white flowers
of the dogwood, mingled with the pink-purple
blossoms of the redbud against the dark primeval
forest. <span class="sidenote">Percy, in Purchas, p. 1689.</span> Wherever they went ashore the newcomers
found "all the ground bespread with many
sweet and delicate flowers of divers colors and
kinds." The sea-weary voyagers concluded that
"heaven and earth had never agreed better to
frame a place for man's habitation."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The first meetings with Indians.</span> They were like people in an enchanted land&mdash;all
was so new and strange. On the first landing
of a small party they had a taste of savage warfare.
"At night, when wee were going aboard,
there came the savages creeping from the Hills
like Beares, with their Bowes in their Mouthes,
charged us very desperately, hurt Captain Gabrill
Archer in both hands, and a Sayler in two places
of the body very dangerous. <span class="sidenote">Percy, in Purchas iv, pp. 1685, 1686.</span> After they had spent
their arrowes, and felt the sharpness of our shot,
they retired into the Woods with a great noise and
so left us."</p>

<p>But the newly arrived did not find all the Indians
hostile. The chief of the Rappahannocks came
to welcome them, marching at the head of his
train, piping on a reed flute, and clad in the fantastic
dress of an Indian dandy. He wore a plate of
copper on the shorn side of his head. The hair on
the other side was wrapped about with deer's hair
dyed red, "in the fashion of a rose." Two long
feathers "like a pair of horns" were stuck in this
rosy crown. His body was stained crimson, his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>(p. 29)</span> face painted blue and besmeared with some glistering
pigment which to the greedy eyes of the
English seemed to be silver ore. <span class="sidenote">A. D. 1607.</span> He wore a chain
of beads, or wampum, about his neck, and his ears
were "all behung with bracelets of pearls." There
also depended from each ear a bird's claw set with
copper&mdash;or "gold," adds the narrator, indulging a
delightful dubiety.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Purchas i, 686 and following.</span> During the period of preliminary exploration
every trait of savage life was eagerly observed by
the English. The costume, the wigwams, and most
of all the ingenious weapons of wood and stone,
gave delight to the curiosity of the newcomers.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Founding of Jamestown.</span> The colonists chose for the site of their town
what was then a malarial peninsula; it has since
become an island. The place was naturally defended
by the river on all sides, except where a
narrow stretch of sand made a bridge to the main.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_1" name="note_b1_c2_1"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_1">Note 1.</a></span>
Its chief advantage in the eyes of the newcomers
was that the deep water near the shore made it
possible to moor the ships by merely tying them
up to trees on the river bank. <span class="sidenote">Relatyon of the Discovery of our River, Am. Antiq.
Soc., iv, 61.</span> Here the settlers
planted cotton and orange trees at once, and experimental
potatoes, melons, and pumpkins, but
they postponed sowing grain until about the first
of June in our reckoning.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The winter of misery.</span> They took up their abode in hastily built cabins
roofed with sedge or bark, and in ragged tents.
The poorer sort were even fain to shelter themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name="page30"></a>(p. 30)</span> in mere burrows in the ground. <span class="sidenote">A. D. 1607.</span> Ill provided
at the start, the greater part of their food was consumed
by the seamen, who lingered to gather comminuted
mica for gold. In this hard environment,
rent by faction, destitute of a competent leader and
of any leader with competent authority, the wonder
is that of this little company a single man survived
the winter. <span class="sidenote">Purchas, p. 1690.</span> "There never were Englishmen
left in any foreign country in such misery as we
were in this new-discovered Virginia," says George
Percy, brother to the Earl of Northumberland. A
pint of worm-eaten barley or wheat was allowed
for a day's ration. This was made into pottage
and served out at the rate of one small ladleful at
each meal. "Our drink was water, our lodgings
castles in the air," says Smith. The misery was
aggravated by a constant fear of attack from the
Indians, who had been repulsed in an energetic
assault made soon after the landing of the English.
It was necessary for each man to watch every
third night "lying on the cold, bare ground," and
this exposure in a fever swamp, with the slender
allowance of food of bad quality and the brackish
river water, brought on swellings, dysenteries, and
fevers. Sometimes there were not five men able
to bear arms. "If there were any conscience in
men," says Percy, "it would make their hearts
bleed to hear the pitiful murmurings and outcries
of our sick men without relief every day and night
for the space of about six weeks." The living were
hardly able to bury the dead, whose bodies were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>(p. 31)</span> "trailed out like dogs." Half of the hundred colonists
died, and the survivors were saved by the
Indians, who, having got a taste of muskets and
cannon in their early attack on Jamestown, now
brought in supplies of game, corn, persimmons, and
other food, to trade for the novel trinkets of the
white men.</p>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Emergence of Captain John Smith.</span> Peril and adversity bring the capable man to
the front. The colony proceeded, by means of the
technicalities habitually used in those days, to rid
itself of its president, Wingfield, a man of good intentions
but with no talents suitable to a place of
such difficulty. Slowly, by one change and then
another, the leadership fell into the hands of Captain
John Smith. During the voyage he had
drawn upon himself the jealousy of the others,
probably by his boastful and self-asserting habit of
speech. When the list of councilors, till then kept
secret, was opened at Jamestown and his name was
found in it, he was promptly excluded by his associates.
It was only on the intercession of the clergyman,
Hunt, that he was at length admitted to
the Council.</p>

<p>His paradoxical character has been much misunderstood.
Those who discredit the historical
accuracy of Captain Smith's narratives consider
his deeds of no value. It is the natural result and
retribution of boasting that the real merit of the
boaster is cast into the rubbish heap of contempt
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>(p. 32)</span> along with his false pretensions. On the other
hand, those who appreciate Smith's services to the
colony in its dire extremities believe that the historical
authority of such a man must be valid.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His romantic tendencies.</span> His character, double and paradoxical as it is,
presents no insoluble enigma if we consider the
forces of nature and of habit underlying its manifestations.
According to his own highly colored
narrative, he had fed his fervid imagination on romances
of chivalry. The first natural result in a
youth so energetic as he, was that he should set
out to emulate the imaginary heroes of whom he
had read. It was equally a matter of course that
a man of his vanity should exaggerate his own adventures
to the size of those that had excited his
admiration. The same romantic turn of the imagination
that sent him a-wandering after exploits
in Flanders and in the wars with the Turks, in
Barbary, and in Ireland, made his every adventure
seem an exploit of heroic size. Such a man is valuable
when boldness and aggressive action are in
request; to relate facts where autobiography is involved
he is little fitted.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His story of his own life.</span> According to Smith's own narrative, he was
robbed and shipwrecked at sea; he slew three infidel
champions in single combat and cut off their
heads, just for the amusement of the ladies; he
was made captive by the Turks and escaped by
slaying his master with a flail; he encountered
pirates; in the plunder of a ship he secured by
the grace of God a box of jewels; and, to round
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>(p. 33)</span> off his story, he was beloved in romance fashion
by a fair Turkish lady, one Tragabigzanda; befriended
by a Russian lady, the good Calamata;
and, later, was snatched from the open jaws of death
by the devotion of the lovely Princess Pocahontas,
daughter of King Powhatan, of Virginia. What
more could one ask? Here are the elements of
all the romances. But, to crown all, he emulated
the misadventure of the prophet Jonah, and he even
out-Jonahed Jonah. He got ashore by mere swimming
without the aid of a whale, when cast overboard
by Catholic pilgrims to appease a tempest.
Never any other wanderer since the safe return of
Ulysses passed through such a succession of marvelous
escapes as this young John Smith. His accidents
and achievements, even without exaggeration,
were fairly notable, doubtless, but they are
forever obscured by his vices of narration.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Interest in colonization.</span> By the time he was twenty-eight years old this
knight-errant had pretty well exhausted Europe as
a field for adventure. Soon after his return to his
own land he found the navigator Gosnold agitating
for a new colony in Virginia, the scene of Ralegh's
failures. That being the most difficult and dangerous
enterprise then in sight, nothing was more
natural than that Smith should embark in it. From
this time to the end of his life this really able
man gave his best endeavors to the advancement
of American colonization. <span class="sidenote">His character.</span> In counsel he was accounted
wise, and his advice was listened to with
more than common deference in the assemblies of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>(p. 34)</span> the Virginia Company as long as the company
lasted. In labor he was indefatigable, in emergencies
he proved himself ready-witted and resourceful.
His recorded geographical observations are
remarkably accurate considering his circumstances,
and his understanding of Indian life shows his intelligence.
His writings on practical questions are
terse, epigrammatic, and wise beyond the wisdom
of his time. But where his own adventures or
credit are involved he is hardly more trustworthy
than Falstaff. His boasting is one of the many difficulties
a historian has to encounter in seeking to
discover the truth regarding the events of an age
much given to lying.</p>

<h4>VII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Smith's exploration and trading.</span> On Smith principally devolved the explorations
for a passage to the Pacific and the conduct of the
Indian trade. He was captured by the Indians in
the swamps of the Chickahominy and carried from
village to village in triumph. Contriving to secure
his release from the head chief, Powhatan, he returned
to Jamestown. Nothing could have suited
better his bold genius and roving disposition than
the life he thereafter led in Virginia. <span class="sidenote">A. D. 1607, 1608.</span> He sailed up
and down the bays and estuaries, discovering and
naming unknown islands, ascending great unknown
rivers, cajoling or bullying the Indians, and returning
to his hungry countrymen at Jamestown
laden with maize from the granaries of the savages. <span class="sidenote">Oxford Tract, <i>passim</i>.</span>
Smith and his companions coasted in all seasons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>(p. 35)</span> and all weather in an open boat, exercising themselves
in morning psalm-singing and praying, in
man&oelig;uvring strange Indians by blustering or point-blank
lying, and in trying to propagate the Christian
religion among the heathen&mdash;all in turn as
occasion offered, like true Englishmen of the Jacobean
time. <span class="sidenote">Gen. Hist <i>passim</i>.</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His narrative.</span> Captain Smith's earlier accounts of these achievements
in Virginia seem to be nearer the truth than
his later Generall Historie. As years rolled on his
exploits gained in number and magnitude in his
memory. The apocryphal story of his expounding
the solar system by means of a pocket compass
to savages whose idiom he had had no opportunity
to learn is to be found only in his later writings.
He is a prisoner but a month in the narrative of
the Oxford Tract of 1612, which was written by
his associates and published with his authority, but
his captivity had grown to six or seven weeks in
the Generall Historie of 1624. His prosaic release
by Powhatan had developed into a romantic rescue
by Pocahontas. Two or three hundred savages in
the earlier account become four or five hundred
in the later. Certain Poles assist him in the capture
of an Indian chief in the authorized narrative
of Pots and Phettiplace. In the later story our
hero performs this feat single-handed. A mere
cipher attaches itself sometimes to the figure representing
the number of his enemies, who by this
simple feat of memory become ten times more redoubtable
than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>(p. 36)</span> <span class="sidenote">His service to the colony.</span> But it does not matter greatly whether the
"strangely grimmed and disguised" Indians seen
by Smith at one place on the Potomac, who, according
to the story, were shouting and yelling
horribly, though in ambuscade, numbered three or
four hundred as in one account, or three or four
thousand as in his later story. <span class="sidenote">Oxf. Tract, p. 32. Gen. Hist., bk. iii, ch. v.</span> To Captain Smith
remains the credit of having been the one energetic
and capable man in those first years&mdash;the
man who wasted no time in a search for gold, but
won from the Indians what was of infinitely greater
value&mdash;the corn needed to preserve the lives of the
colonists. In an open boat, with no instrument
but a compass, he explored and mapped Chesapeake
Bay so well that his map was not wholly
superseded for a hundred and forty years. <span class="sidenote">Historie of Travaile into Virginia, p. 41.</span> Even
Wingfield, who had reason to dislike Smith, recognizes
the value of his services; and Strachey, who
had every means of knowing, says that "there
will not return from" Virginia "in hast any one
who hath bene more industrious or who hath had
(Captain Geo. Percie excepted) greater experience
amongst them, however misconstruction maye traduce
here at home."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Smith overthrown.</span> During the autumn of 1608 and the winter following
Captain Smith was sole ruler of Jamestown,
all the other councilors having gone; but
the next spring there arrived five hundred new
colonists inadequately provisioned, and under two
of the old faction leaders who were Smith's mortal
enemies. These were the visionary and turbulent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>(p. 37)</span> Archer and his follower Ratcliffe. <span class="sidenote">A. D. 1609.</span> Smith got
some of the newcomers to settle at Nansemond,
and others took up their abode near the falls of
the James River. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_2" name="note_b1_c2_2"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_2">Note 2.</a></span> After much turmoil Smith was
disabled by an accident, and his enemies contrived
to have him sent home charged, among other
things, with having "incensed" the Indians to assault
the insubordinate settlers under West near
the falls, and with having designed to wed Pocahontas
in order to secure royal rights in Virginia
as son-in-law to Powhatan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His later years.</span> He afterward explored the New England coast
with characteristic thoroughness and intelligence.
What he published in his later years by way of
advice on the subject of colony-planting is full of
admirable good sense. With rare foresight he predicted
the coming importance of the colonial trade
and the part to be played by the American fisheries
in promoting the greatness of England by
"breeding mariners." He only of the men of his
time suspected the imperial size and future greatness
of North America. He urged that the colonies
should not annoy "with large pilotage and
such like dues" those who came to trade in their
ports. Low customs, he says, enrich a people.
This is a strange doctrine in an age when foreign
trade seemed almost an evil, and false conceptions
of economic principles were nearly universal.
Captain Smith's words are often pregnant with a
wit whose pungency is delightful. In mental and
physical hardihood, and in what may be called
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>(p. 38)</span> shiftiness, as well as in proneness to exaggeration
and in boastfulness, he was in some sense a typical
American pioneer&mdash;a forerunner of the daring and
ready-witted men who have subdued a savage
continent. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_3" name="note_b1_c2_3"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_3">Note 3.</a></span></p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The famine of 1609-'10.</span> Disaster of some sort could hardly have been
avoided had Captain Smith been allowed to stay,
but after his departure ruin came swiftly, and there
was no hand strong enough to stay it. The unchecked
hostility of the savages drove the outsettlers
from Nansemond and the falls of the James.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_4" name="note_b1_c2_4"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_4">Note 4.</a></span> The Indians found exercise for their devilish ingenuity
in torturing those who fell into their hands
alive, and outraging the dead. <span class="sidenote">A. D. 1609, 1610.</span> The brave but unwise
Percy added fuel to their consuming fury
by visiting their shrine and desecrating the tombs
of their chiefs. There was now no one who could
carry on the difficult Indian trade. Ratcliffe, who
had conspired to send Smith back to England, fell
into an ambuscade while emulating Captain Smith's
example in trading with Powhatan. He was tortured
to death by the Indian women, and only
fifteen of his fifty men got back to Jamestown.
The brood hogs of the colony were all eaten, the
dogs came next, and then the horses, which were
to have stocked Virginia, were consumed to their
very hides. Rats, mice, and adders were relished
when they were to be had, and fungi of various
sorts were eaten with whatever else "would fill
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>(p. 39)</span> either mouth or belly." <span class="sidenote">A. D. 1610.</span> An Indian slain in an
assault on the stockade was dug up after he had
been three days buried, and eaten "by the poorer
sort," their consuming hunger not being embarrassed
by the restraints of gentility. From this
horrible expedient it was but one step to the digging
up of their own dead for food. Famine-crazed
men even dogged the steps of those of their
comrades who were not quite wasted, threatening
to kill and devour them. Among these despairing
and shiftless men there was but one man of
resources. Daniel Tucker&mdash;let his later sins as
tyrant of Bermuda be forgiven&mdash;bethought himself
to build a boat to catch fish in the river, and this
small relief "did keep us from killing one another
to eat," says Percy. He seems to have been the
only man who bethought himself to do anything.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_5" name="note_b1_c2_5"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_5">Note 5.</a></span>
One man, in the ferocity engendered by famine,
slew his own wife and salted what he did not eat
at once of her flesh, but he was put to death at
the stake for this crime. Some, braving the savages,
sought food in the woods and died while
seeking it, and were eaten by those who found
them dead. Others, in sheer desperation, threw
themselves on the tender mercies of the Indians
and were slain. To physical were added spiritual
torments. One despairing wretch threw his Bible
into the fire, crying out in the market place that
there was no God in heaven. Percy adds, with
grim theological satisfaction characteristic of the
time, that he was killed by the Indians in the very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>(p. 40)</span> market place where he had blasphemed in his
agony. The depopulated houses, and even the
palisades so necessary for protection, were burned
for firewood by the enfeebled people, and Jamestown
came presently to look like the slumbering
ruins of some ancient fortification. <span class="sidenote">Tragicall Relation, 1623. Briefe Declaration, 1624,
both in British Pub. Record Office. Percy's Trewe Relacyon, MS.,
Petworth House.</span> Fortunately,
the Indians did not think it worth while to lose
any more of their men in attacking the desperate
remainder. It seemed inevitable that all who were
shut up in the Jamestown peninsula should perish
of hunger in a very few days. Of the nearly five
hundred colonists in Virginia in the autumn of
1609, there were but sixty famine-smitten wretches
alive in the following June, and hardly one of
these could have survived had help been delayed
a few days longer.</p>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The arrival of Gates and Somers, 1610.</span> Relief came to the little remnant from a quarter
whence it was least expected. The emigrants of
the preceding year had been sent out under the
authority of Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George
Somers. The two leaders were jealous of each
other, and for fear either should gain advantage by
prior arrival they embarked in the same ship.
<span class="sidenote">A True Declaration of the Estate of the Colony of
Virginia, 1619, p.23.</span> This ship became separated from the rest of the
fleet and went ashore on the Bermudas, then uninhabited,
and "accounted as an inchaunted pile of
rockes and a desert inhabitation for Divels," in the
words of a writer of the time; "but all the fairies
of the rocks were but flocks of birds, and all the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>(p. 41)</span> Divels that haunted the woods were but herds of
swine." <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_6" name="note_b1_c2_6"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_6">Note 6.</a></span> Here old Sir George Somers, a veteran
seaman, constructed two little cedar vessels, and
provisioning them for the voyage with what the
islands afforded&mdash;live turtles, and the flesh of wild
hogs and waterfowl salted&mdash;the company set sail
for Virginia in the spring of 1610, arriving barely
in time to save the colony from extinction. Finding
that their provisions would not last more than
two or three weeks, they abandoned the wreck of
Jamestown, crowding all the people into four pinnaces,
including the two improvised cedar boats
built on the Bermudas. They sailed down the
river in the desperate hope of surviving until they
could reach Newfoundland and get supplies from
fishing vessels. The four little craft were turned
back on encountering Lord De la Warr, the new
governor, ascending the James to take charge of
the colony. The meeting with De la Warr was
bitterly regretted by the old settlers, who preferred
the desperate chance of a voyage in pinnaces
on a shipless sea with but a fortnight's provision
to facing again the horrors of life at
Jamestown.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">De la Warr's arrival, 1610.</span> With all the formalities thought necessary at
that time, De la Warr took possession of Jamestown,
now become a forlorn ruin full of dead men's
bones. Gates was sent to England for a new stock
of cattle, while the brave old Sir George Somers
once more embarked for the Bermudas in the Patience,
the little cedar pinnace which he had built
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>(p. 42)</span> wholly of the wood of that island without a particle
of iron except one bolt in the keel. <span class="sidenote">Smith's Oxford Tract, so called.</span> In this boat
he sailed up and down until he found again "the
still vexed Bermoothes," where he hoped to secure
provisions. He died in the islands. Argall was
also sent to the Bermudas, but missed them, and
went north to the fishing banks in search of food.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_7" name="note_b1_c2_7"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_7">Note 7.</a></span> Jamestown was cleansed, and with a piety characteristic
of that age the deserted little church was
enlarged and reoccupied and daily decorated with
Virginia wild flowers. <span class="sidenote">De la Warr's government, 1610.</span> All the bitter experience of
the first three years had not taught the true method
of settling a new country. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_8" name="note_b1_c2_8"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_8">Note 8.</a></span> The colony was still
but a camp of men without families, and the old
common stock system was retained. To escape
from the anarchy which resulted from a system
that sank the interest of the individual in that of
the community, it had been needful to arm De la
Warr with the sharp sword of martial law. <span class="sidenote">British Museum, MS. 21,993, ff. 174, 178. Instr. to
Gates and De la Warr.</span> Some
of the instructions given him were unwise, some
impossible of execution. To convert the Indians
out of hand, as he was told to do, by shutting up
their medicine men or sending them to England to
be Christianized by the methods then in use, did
not seem a task easy of accomplishment, for Indian
priests are not to be caught in time of war.
But De la Warr undertook another part of his instructions.
<span class="sidenote">Gold-hunting.</span> A hundred men under two captains
were sent on a wild-goose chase up the James
River to find gold or silver in the mountains,
whither the phantom of mines had now betaken
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>(p. 43)</span> itself. This plan originated with the London managers
of Virginia affairs, and men had been sent
with De la Warr who were supposed to be skillful
in "finding out mines." But being especially
unskillful in dealing with the Indians, they were
tempted ashore by savages, who offered them food
and slew them "while the meate was in theire
mouthes." <span class="sidenote">Briefe Declaration, MS., Pub. Rec. Off.</span> The expedition thereupon turned back
at a point about forty miles above the present site
of Richmond.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Flight of De la Warr.</span> A new town was begun at the falls, in the fond
belief that two mines were near, and De la Warr
took up his residence there. Jamestown, drawing
its water from a shallow and probably polluted
well, became the seat of a fresh epidemic. In the
month of March following his arrival the governor
fled from the colony to save his own life, leaving
Virginia more than ever discredited.</p>

<h4>X.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sir Thomas Dale, 1611.</span> As the hope of immediate profit from Virginia
died away, the colony would have been abandoned
if there had not arisen in its favor a patriotic enthusiasm
which gave it a second lease of life.
Many of the great noblemen were deeply engaged
in this new agitation in favor of the unlucky colony,
and none more deeply, perhaps, than Prince
Henry, the heir apparent. <span class="sidenote">Docs. Rel. to Col. Hist. N. Y., i, pp. 1, 2, 3, 9, 10,
16-21.</span> At Henry's request,
Sir Thomas Dale, an officer who had been employed
about the prince's person, and who with
other English officers was now in the service of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>(p. 44)</span> the Netherlands, was granted leave of absence to
go to Virginia. Since the colony was a check to
Spain, the Netherlands were supposed to have an
indirect interest in the enterprise and were persuaded
to continue Captain Dale's pay. De la
Warr, who remained in England, was nominally
governor; Gates, when present in Virginia, was
the ranking officer; but for five years Dale appears
to have been the ruling spirit in the colony.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The heavy hand of Dale, 1611-1616.</span> To induce him to go, Dale had been deceived
regarding the condition of the plantation, as had
been everybody else that had gone to Jamestown
after the first ships sailed. The vice-admiral, Newport,
was the principal reporter of Virginia affairs
in England and the principal agent of the company
in this deception. Dale's rough temper was already
well known. It was for this, no doubt, that
he had been chosen to do a rude piece of work.
<span class="sidenote">A Briefe Declaration of the Plantation of Virginia,
1624, MS., Pub. Rec. Off.</span> On his arrival he saw the desperate state of the
undertaking. He pulled Vice-Admiral Newport's
beard and threatened him with the gallows, demanding
"whether it weare meant that people
heere in Virginia shoulde feed uppon trees."</p>

<p>Under the inefficient government of George
Percy, who had again been placed in charge, the
seedtime of 1611 was allowed to pass without the
planting of corn. The Jamestown people were
found by Dale "at their daily and usual work
bowling in the streets." <span class="sidenote">Brit. Museum, MS., 21,993, f. 174.</span> But the days of unthrifty
idleness were at an end. "The libertyes, ffranchises,
and immunityes of free denizens and natural-born
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>(p. 45)</span> subjects of any our other dominions" promised to
the colonists, were also at an end from the moment
of the arrival of this sharp-set soldier and disciplinarian.
Dale's pitiless use of martial law turned
Virginia not exactly into a military camp, but
rather into a penal settlement where men suffered
for the crime of emigration. The men taken to
Virginia in Dale's own company were hardly fit for
anything else, and were so "diseased and crazed
in their bodies" that at one time not more than
sixty out of three hundred were capable of labor. <span class="sidenote">Briefe Declaration.</span>
The food sent with Sir Thomas Dale by the corrupt
contractors was "of such qualitie as hoggs refused
to eat." Sir Thomas Gates afterward made
oath to its badness before the Chief Justice in
London.</p>

<h4>XI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The years of slavery.</span> Dale regarded himself as an agent of the company.
His aim was by hook or crook to make the
hitherto unprofitable colony pay dividends to the
shareholders, who were his employers. His relation
to the emigrants was that of a taskmaster; one
might, perhaps, more fitly call him a slave-driver.
Instead of seeking to render the colony self-supporting
by clearing corn ground, he gave his first
attention to lading vessels with sassafras root, then
much prized as a medicine, and cedar timber, valued
especially for its odor.</p>

<p>During a part of Dale's time eight or nine
ounces of meal and half a pint of peas was the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>(p. 46)</span> daily ration. <span class="sidenote">Briefe Declaration. Percy to Northumberland, Hist. MS.,
Commission, Rept., iii, 53, 54.</span> In their declaration, made some years
afterward, the surviving colonists aver that both
the meal and the peas were "moldy, rotten, full of
cobwebs and maggots, loathsome to man and unfit
for beasts." Better men than these might have
been driven to mutiny by the enforced toil and
bad food. And mutiny and desertion were usually
but other names for suicide under the rule of the
pitiless high marshal. Some fled to the woods,
hoping to reach a mythical Spanish settlement believed
to be not very far away. Dale set the Indians
on them, and they were brought back to be
burned at the stake. Others, who in desperation
or deadly homesickness resolved to venture their
lives in a barge and a shallop "for their native
country," suffered in various ways for their temerity.
Death by shooting or hanging was clemency.
One offender was put to death by the awful torture
of breaking on the wheel, a penalty that Dale may
have learned during his stay on the Continent.
Taylor, the water poet, has left us the sickening
details of such an execution in Germany in 1616.
<span class="sidenote">Observations and Travel from London to Hamburgh, p.
13.</span> One need not waste any sympathy on those who
were hanged for stealing to satisfy hunger; death
is more merciful than life to men in such a case.
But one poor rogue, who thought to better his rations
by filching two or three pints of oatmeal, had
a bodkin run through his tongue and was chained
to a tree until he perished of hunger. Though
these things were twice attested by the best men
in the colony, one prefers to make some allowance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>(p. 47)</span> for their passionate resentment, and to hope that
some of the horrors related are exaggerated. It is
hard to believe, for example, that men unable to
work were denied food, and left to creep away
into the wretched burrows in the ground used for
shelter, there to die unregarded in the general
misery.</p>

<p>In 1612 a company of ten men sent out to catch
fish braved the perils of the ocean in a little bark
and got back to England. It was the only escape
from Dale's tyranny, pitiless and infernal. "Abandon
every hope who enter here" was almost as
appropriate to the mouth of the James River as to
the gate of Dante's hell. All letters of complaint
sent to England were intercepted, and all efforts
of friends of the colonists in England to succor or
rescue them were thwarted by the company in
London. <span class="sidenote">Briefe Declaration.</span> The king's pass to one of the colonists
authorizing him to leave Virginia was sent to him
by his friends closely made up in a garter, to avoid
the vigilance of Sir Thomas Dale.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dale's services.</span> Dale's administration was strongest on its military
side. There was no danger that the Indians
would reduce the colony to any straits while he
was in charge. He gave his first attention to fortification,
and he even begged for two thousand convicts
out of English jails to form a line of posts
from Hampton to a point a hundred miles above
Jamestown. He sent Argall all the way to Mount
Desert to plunder a Jesuit settlement and make
prize of a French ship&mdash;an undertaking congenial
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>(p. 48)</span> to Dale's military temper and the Viking tastes of
Argall. As his experience increased, Dale came to
understand that other than military measures were
needed to found a colony, though he never more
than half comprehended the elements of the problem.
In his later time he cleared more corn
ground, and he could boast at his departure that
Virginia contained six horses, a hundred and forty-nine
neat cattle, two hundred and sixteen goats,
and hogs without number. Dale set off a private
garden of three acres of land to each of the old
planters, on the condition that they should provide
food for themselves while still giving nearly all of
their time to the service of the common stock.
Even this slave's-patch of private interest given
to only a fraction of the colonists put some life
into Virginia; but two thirds of the people were
retained in the old intolerable bondage, and not
even the most favored secured personal ownership
of land. Dale's administration was remembered
as "the five years of slavery."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_9" name="note_b1_c2_9"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_9">Note 9.</a></span></p>

<h4>XII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dale's return.</span> The rough-handed soldier from the Low Countries
had indeed brought the Virginia chaos into
order, but it was an order almost as deadly as the
preceding anarchy. Dale confessed that the government
of Virginia was "the hardest task he had
ever undertaken," and he got himself out of it after
five years by making a theatrical return to England
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>(p. 49)</span> in 1616 with a train of Indians, including the "Princess"
Pocahontas, converted, baptized with a Christian
name as Rebecca, and wedded to an Englishman.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_10" name="note_b1_c2_10"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_10">Note 10.</a></span>
He added glowing reports of the country,
and proved all by exhibiting "at least sixteen several
sorts of staple commodities to be raised in this
plantation." For greater effect, samples of twelve
of these products of the colony were sold by public
auction in the open court of the company.
Though Dale could show many commodities, some
of which have never flourished in Virginia since
his time, he left behind him not an established community,
but a mere camp of unhappy men retained
in the country by the sheer impossibility of getting
away. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_11" name="note_b1_c2_11"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_11">Note 11.</a></span> After nine years of suffering, Virginia consisted
of some three hundred and twenty-six men,
twenty-five women and children, and graves outnumbering
many times over all the living souls.</p>

<p>Three things had been discovered in Dale's
time that were of importance to the colony. Dale
had by personal experiment learned the two fishing
seasons in the James River. The colonists had
begun the profitable cultivation of tobacco, and
the economic success of the colony was thereby
assured. Lastly, even Dale's small experiment with
private interest rendered the apportionment of the
land and the establishment of private ownership
certain to come in time. As early as 1614 it was
estimated that three men working for themselves
raised more corn than ten times as many when the
labor was for the public stock.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_12" name="note_b1_c2_12"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_12">Note 12.</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>(p. 50)</span> XIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Argall's government.</span> Captain Argall, who succeeded Sir Thomas
Dale, was a bold and notable mariner. He had
built the first Virginia vessel; he had traded with
the Indians for corn with as much enterprise and
address as Captain Smith had shown; he had in a
small ship called the Dainty made the first experimental
voyage to James River by the westward
route, avoiding the long circuit by the Canaries
and West Indies. It had been his fortune to be
the first Englishman to see the American bison,
which he found near the Potomac. He it was who
by a shrewd trick had captured Pocahontas and
held her as hostage; and he drove the French out
of Maine, despoiling their settlement at Mount
Desert. To a mastery of all the arts that make the
skillful navigator he added the courteous politeness
of a man of the city and the unfaltering
rapacity of a pirate. As governor, he robbed the
company with one hand and the hapless colonists
with the other. While using the ships and men of
the colony to carry on the Indian trade, he turned
all the profits of it into his own wallet. The breeding
animals of the colony accumulated by Dale he
sold, and made no account of the proceeds. There
was hardly anything portable or salable in Virginia
that he did not purloin. He even plundered
the property of Lady De la Warr, the widow of
his predecessor. He boldly fitted out a ship belonging
to Lord Rich, and sent an expedition of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>(p. 51)</span> sheer piracy to the West Indies under an old letter
of marque from the Duke of Savoy. When advices
from England warned Argall that his downfall was
imminent, he forthwith redoubled his felonious
diligence. <span class="sidenote">Lord Rich's intrigue.</span> His chief partner in England was Lord
Rich, who became the second Earl of Warwick in
1619, about the time of Argall's return, and who is
known to history in his later character as a great
Puritan nobleman, who served God while he contrived
to better his estate with both hands by such
means as troublous times put within his reach.
He was not content with small pickings. Rich appears
to have aimed at nothing less than wrecking
the company and securing the land and government
of Virginia. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_13" name="note_b1_c2_13"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_13">Note 13.</a></span> The first step toward this was
to get a charter for a private or proprietary plantation
within Virginia which should be exempt
from all authority of the company and the colony.
This independent government was to serve as a
refuge from prosecutions for Argall and other piratical
agents, and at last to possess itself of the
wreck and remainder of Virginia. The second
step in this intrigue was one that could have
availed nothing in any time less respectful to shadowy
technicalities and less prone to legal chicanery
than that of James I. As we have seen, jealousy
was excited in Virginia by the possibility of Captain
Smith's wedding Pocahontas and setting up a
claim to authority based on her inheritance from
Powhatan. <span class="sidenote">Stith, 142.</span> A tradition lingered in Virginia a
hundred years later that King James questioned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>(p. 52)</span> Rolfe's right to intermarry with a foreign princess
without the consent of his sovereign. If this had
any foundation, it grew out of the value of a pretext
in a time of technicality and intrigue. There
may have been already a scheme to trade upon
the hereditary right of Powhatan's daughter. Pocahontas
died in England, leaving an infant son.
Argall, on his arrival, hastened to notify the company
that Opechankano, the brother and successor
of Powhatan, had resolved not to sell any more
land, but to reserve it for the son of Pocahontas
when he should be grown. The company charged
that this was a ruse to serve the ends which Argall,
Rich, and others had in view. The larger plan
miscarried, but Argall found his prey so tempting
that he lingered longer than was safe, and got away
in the nick of time by the aid of Lord Rich, who
had stood guard like a burglar's pal, and who contrived
to delay the ship carrying out the new
governor until a small swift-sailing vessel could be

<p><span class="sidenote">Fall of the lottery.</span> From the first nobody reaped any profit from
investments made in the new colony except the
clique of merchants who had been allowed to sell
wretched supplies for the distant settlers at ruinous
rates. Rich and those interested with him had
abundantly reimbursed themselves for all outlays
on their part. The Virginia Company, swindled by
commercial peculators at home, robbed by a pirate
governor in America, and embarrassed by Spanish
intrigues at the English court, had also been deprived
of the lotteries, large and small, which had
supplied money for sending eight hundred emigrants
to Virginia. The lottery, which had fallen
into great disrepute and had suffered "many foul
aspersions," was abolished in compliance with a
public sentiment. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_14" name="note_b1_c2_14"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_14">Note 14.</a></span> The company was tottering
swiftly to a fall; vultures like Warwick were waiting
longingly for its death.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Revival of interest, 1618.</span> But there set in once more a widespread patriotic
movement in its behalf. Such movements
were characteristic of that vital age when love of
country was fast coming to count for more as a
motive to action than loyalty to the person of a
prince. "Divers lords, knights, gentlemen, and
citizens, grieved to see this great action fall to
nothing," came to its rescue with one final effort
which resulted after some years in putting the enterprise
well beyond the danger of failure. They
formed auxiliary societies within the Virginia Company,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>(p. 54)</span> after the custom of corporations in that day.
Each of these undertook to plant a settlement or
"hundred." In one year the population rose from
less than four hundred to about a thousand. The
newly active element infused a more liberal spirit
into the company, and set about correcting the
abuses in its management.</p>

<h4>XV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Great Charter, 1618.</span> The movement of 1618 was retarded by the disgrace
into which the colony had fallen. An unbroken
series of misfortunes and disappointments,
the bad conduct of the company's affairs, the ill
fame of Dale's remorseless tyranny, and the fresh
Argall scandal, had made Virginia odious. <span class="sidenote">Pub. Rec. Off. Col. Papers, iii, 40. Disc. of the Old
Va. Co.</span> One
convict to whom the alternative was proposed,
chose hanging in preference to transportation to
Virginia. It was needful that something should be
done to restore credit. The men who took the
lead in the patriotic movement of 1618 on behalf of
Virginia were mainly liberal statesmen&mdash;that Earl
of Southampton who is known as the friend of
Shakespeare; Sir Edwin Sandys, one of the greatest
men of a great age, whose brave support of
popular liberty had lost him the favor of the king;
Sir John Danvers, and others. The records before
the election of Sandys in 1619 were probably destroyed
to conceal the guilt of the managers. We
can only conjecture that the rising influence of the
men who were able a few months later to overthrow
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>(p. 55)</span> the ruling party had much to do with the
most notable change that took place in the conduct
of affairs in the Virginia Company at this
time. On the 13th of November, 1618&mdash;memorable
but neglected and forgotten date&mdash;the Virginia
Company, acting within the powers conferred on
it by its charter, granted to the residents in Virginia
a document styled a "Great Charter or Commissions
of Priviledges, Orders, and Lawes." No
copy of this instrument now exists, but some of its
provisions have been preserved. It established a
legislative body, to consist of councilors of estate
and of representatives or burgesses chosen by the
several "plantations" or hundreds, and it limited
the power of the governor. This charter was the
starting point of constitutional government in the
New World. It contained in embryo the American
system of an executive power lodged mainly
in one person, and a Legislature of two houses.
One might without much exaggeration call this
paper a sort of Magna Charta of America, and it
was a long and probably a deliberate step toward
popular government. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_15" name="note_b1_c2_15"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_15">Note 15.</a></span> If the results that have followed
it be considered, it can hardly be accounted
second in importance to any other state paper of
the seventeenth century.</p>

<h4>XVI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Division of land.</span> Not only did this admirable charter establish a
representative form of government and do away
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>(p. 56)</span> with martial law, but it fairly launched the Virginians
on the current of freedom and advancement
by authorizing a liberal division of land to all
those who had arrived before the departure of Sir
Thomas Dale. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_16" name="note_b1_c2_16"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_16">Note 16.</a></span> The oldest land titles in Virginia

on Virginia in 1609, "but was altogether careless
of the succeeding penurie." The distribution of
land abolished the common stock system of labor,
and opened a pathway to the ambition of the
diligent.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The good news in Virginia.</span> Tidings of the great change wrought in their
condition and prospects by the new charter reached
the dwellers on the James River in the spring of
1619, and the colonists were "ravished with so
much joy" that they felt themselves "now fully
satisfied for their long labors and as happy men as
there were in the world." <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_17" name="note_b1_c2_17"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_17">Note 17.</a></span> They valued their liberties
as no man can who has not known the bitterness
of bondage, and in 1623, when they had reason
to fear the re-establishment of the old tyranny, the
Virginia Assembly petitioned the king in these
strong words: "Rather than be reduced to live
under the like government, we desire his Majesty
that commissioners may be sent over to hang us." <span class="sidenote">Tragicall Relation, 1623.</span>
We have here, perhaps, the very first of the many
protests of colonial Legislatures against oppression
from England.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The sending of wives to Virginia.</span> In 1618, before the adoption of the charter, it
was concluded, in the quaint phrase of the time,
"that a plantation can never flourish till families be
planted and the respects of Wives and Children fix
the people on the soyle," or, in simpler words, that
a colony of bachelors can hardly found a state. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_18" name="note_b1_c2_18"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_18">Note 18.</a></span>
The first ship laden with home-makers carried over
ninety maids, and the company thought it necessary
to promise special rewards to the men who
should marry these young women. If the maids
were as certified, "young, handsome, and well recommended,"
they needed no such dowry in a land
that had hardly a woman in it. Young or old,
handsome or homely, the maids did not prove a
drug. Shipload after shipload of them were eagerly
bought by the planters, who had to pay a round
sum in the high-priced tobacco of that early time
to defray the cost of transporting these wives.
Besides having to pay for his wife, the planter
could have her only on the condition of winning
her consent; and the eager courtship that ensued
on the arrival of a shipload of maids must have
been one of the most amusing scenes in the settlement
of America. Suitors far outnumbered the
women, and the latter had things pretty much their
own way. The first cargo of this interesting merchandise
was landed in 1619, but as late as 1624
the women were probably in danger of setting the
colonists by the ears, for the governor felt obliged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name="page58"></a>(p. 58)</span> to issue a proclamation threatening fine or whipping
for the offense of betrothal to more than one
person at a time. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c2_19" name="note_b1_c2_19"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c2_19">Note 19.</a></span> In 1632, thirteen years after the
first shipment, we find the colony still being replenished
with women sent in the same fashion.
In that year, two, whose behavior during the voyage
had been disgraceful, were sent back as unfit
to be mothers of Virginians. The precaution could
not have been of much practical use, but it indicates
the early growth of a wholesome local pride.
When there were house mothers in the cabins, and
children born in the country, the settlers no longer
dreamed of returning to England; and there was
soon a young generation that knew no other skies
than those that spanned the rivers, fields, and vast
primeval forests of their native Virginia, which
now for the first time became a home.</p>

<h4>XVIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The struggle ended, 1624.</span> It is not the Virginia colony alone that we have
seen in the crucible. The fate of English colonization
was no doubt settled by the experiments made
during the first years on the James River, and the
story told in this chapter is but the overture to the
whole history of life in the United States. In our
colonizing age a settlement might be made in the
heart of Africa with a far smaller loss of life than
was incurred in the first sixteen years in Virginia.
From 1607 to 1623 there were landed in Virginia
more than six thousand people. The number that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>(p. 59)</span> returned to England was inconsiderable, but in the
year 1624, when the colony passed under a royal
government, there remained alive in the colony
only twelve hundred and seventy-five. Of those
who came in these early years four fifths perished.
A part of this loss was due to radically wrong conceptions
of the nature, end, and proper methods of
colonization, a part to corrupt and incompetent
management in the London Company. The bad
character of many of the earliest emigrants was
one cause of difficulty. The writers of the time
probably exaggerated this evil in order to excuse
the severity of the government and the miseries
into which the settlers fell. But the loss of many
of the early comers must be accounted a distinct
gain to Virginia. Unfitted for their environment,
they were doomed to extinction by that pitiless
law which works ever to abolish from the earth
the improvident, the idle, and the vicious.</p>

trace of Sandy Beach which had connected the island with the
mainland. This bit of sand, in the antique phrase of one of the
early colonists, was "no broader than a man may well quaite a
tileshard." Strachey, in Purchas, p. 1752. Jamestown is now
a farm; the ruins of the church and many of the tombs in the
eighteenth-century churchyard remain; but the upper end of the
island is wearing away, and I picked out of the crumbling sand,
far from the later burying place, human bones of earlier burials,
possibly of the victims of the famines and epidemics. The walls
of the magazine had been exposed by erosion. I brought away
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>(p. 60)</span> wrought nails, bits of glass grown iridescent from long burial,
and an exploded bombshell of so small a caliber as to mark
its antiquity. By the aid of a negro youth living on the farm
I found the hearth bricks turned up in various places by the
plow, and the arrangement, or rather lack of arrangement, of
the town could thus be made out. My guide volunteered the information
that Jamestown was "the first place discovered after
the Flood." Some drawings made at the time were reproduced
with an article on Nathaniel Bacon in the Century Magazine for
July, 1890.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b1_c2_2" name="anote_b1_c2_2"></a><a href="#note_b1_c2_2">Note 2, page 37.</a></span> Whether Smith was injured by gunpowder and required treatment,
as he asserts, or was sent home under charges, has been
matter of dispute. Both accounts are correct, as is shown by
the testimony of an important manuscript at Petworth House, in
Surrey, which I was allowed to examine by the courtesy of Lord
Leconsfield. It is from the pen of George Percy, a brother of
the Earl of Northumberland, who was chosen to succeed Smith
on his departure from the colony. It is not the narrative from
which Purchas makes extracts, but a sequel to it. The title is
"A Trewe Relacyon of the pceedinge and Ocvrrentes of momente
wch have hapned in Virginia from the Tyme Sr Thomas
Gates was shipwrackde vpon the Bermudes Ano. 1609 vntill my
depture ovtt of the country wch was in Ano Dni 1612." It is a
quarto of forty-one pages. Percy was a man of courage, but
his own narrative in this little book shows that he had no qualification
for the office of governor except the rank of his family.
His ill health is made an excuse for his inefficiency, but Dale's
letter of May 25, 1611, shows that even the horrible events of
Percy's first government had not taught him to plant corn when
again left in charge. Percy naturally resents Smith's boastfulness,
and bluntly accuses him of laying claim to credit that
was not his. The charge that Smith, unable to control the unruly
settlers at the Falls under West, advised the Indians to attack
them, is supported by Percy; and a very different charge,
that he stirred up the Indians to assassinate West himself, appears
at a later time in Spelman's Relation, a tract that bears
abundant internal evidence of the writer's mental inability to
speak the truth. Percy himself relates that the Indians were
already hostile to West's party, and that they had wounded and
killed some of West's men in resentment of their wanton outrages.
See also the account in the Oxford Tract, with the signatures
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>(p. 61)</span> of Pots and Phettiplace, for Smith's version of the affair.
"Bloody-mindedness" seems not to have been a trait of Smith.
But the exigency was a terrible one, for death by starvation was
already impending, and only the restoration of discipline at any
cost could have saved the colony from the horrible fate it met.
Such a course would not have done much violence to the notions
of the time, and would have found precedents in the various plots
against the lives of Smith, Wingfield, and others in the colony.
It is quite probable, however, that there is no truth in the story.
The violent hatred of the factions will account for the suspicion.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b1_c2_3" name="anote_b1_c2_3"></a><a href="#note_b1_c2_3">Note 3, page 38.</a></span> Captain Smith's True Relation was sent from Virginia and
was printed in London in 1608. In 1612 he published what is
commonly referred to as the Oxford Tract. Its proper title is
very long. The first part of it is as follows: "Map of Virginia,
with a description of the Covntry, the Commodities, People, Government,
and Religion. Written by Captain Smyth, sometime
Governor of the Covntry. And wherevnto is annexed the proceedings
of those colonies since their first departure from England,"
etc. The second part of the book professes to be taken
from the writings of eight of the colonists, whose names are given,
and to have been edited by W. S.&mdash;that is, the Reverend Dr.
Symonds. The Generall Historie was first proposed in a well-considered
and rather elegant speech by Captain Smith at a meeting
of the Virginia Company, April 12, 1621, while the new patent
which was to be submitted to Parliament was under discussion.
He suggested the writing of a history to preserve the memory of
the worthies of Virginia, dead and living, and gave it as his
opinion that no Spanish settlement of the same age afforded matter
more interesting. "Which worthy speech," says the record,
"had of the whole court a very great applause as spoken freely
to a speciall purpose, and therefore thought fitt to be considered
and put in practice in his due time. And for which also Mr.
Smyth as preferring allwaies mocions of speciall consequence was
exceedingly commended." MS. Records of the Virginia Company,
i, 197-200. A first edition of the Generall Historie appeared
in 1624, the last two editions in 1632. The book is a
compilation of Smith's earlier works, somewhat expanded, not to
say inflated. The later portions are mostly made up from the
official and <i>quasi</i>-official pamphlets. Just what was Dr. Symonds's
part in the preparation of the Oxford Tract and the
Generall Historie it would be interesting to know. The latter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>(p. 62)</span> work was in some sense by authority of the company, and liable
to the peculiar suspicion that hangs about writings designed to
advance the colony and not primarily to record history. Its descriptive
portions are of high value, and we are now able to control
its historical errors to a certain extent. Besides these three
works on Virginia, Smith published a Description of New England,
1616, New England's Trials, 1620, and Advertisements for
the Unexperienced Planters of New England or Elsewhere, in
1631, the year of his death. These all contain valuable matter
relating to Virginia. He also published in 1627 two works on
seamanship, a Sea Grammar, and the Accidence or Pathway to
Experience necessary for a Young Seaman. In 1630 he published
his True Travels, a book which contains an account of his
own adventures previous to his going to Virginia. More than a
quarter of a century had elapsed between the occurrence of these
adventures and their publication. Smith's vivid imagination had
meantime no doubt greatly magnified his own exploits. It is
quite impossible at this day to sift what truth there is in the True
Travels from the exaggerations. Travelers in that time were not
held to a very rigid account, and their first obligation seems to
have been to amuse their readers. No distinct line had yet been
drawn in literature between fact and fiction.</p>

<p>Many years ago, before I had had an opportunity to examine
and compare all his writings, I rashly printed a brief argument in
favor of the trustworthiness of Captain John Smith and the credibility
of the Pocahontas story. I believe no person of critical
judgment can make a thorough comparison of Smith's successive
books without being convinced of the ineradicable tendency of his
mind to romance in narrating adventure, especially his own adventure.
Even his style where his vanity speaks loses something
of its native directness and force. His practical writings on navigation
and on the proper conduct of colonization, and his descriptions
of the country and the savages, are plain, direct, and
lucid. His speeches in the Virginia Company appear to have
been exceedingly wise, and to have impressed his hearers. Note,
for example, his proposals (Records, i, 197) that colonial governors
should be liable to trial in England; his proposal to reduce
the fee for sending a child to Virginia from five pounds to five
marks, the cost of apprenticing to a trade (i, 174); and his preference
for a governor well paid to one working "for love" (February
4, 1623). His personal morals were probably unexceptionable.
One of his associates certifies to his freedom from tobacco,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>(p. 63)</span> wines, dice, debts, and oaths. But a comparison between the
statements made in the Oxford Tract and those in the Generall
Historie leaves upon the mind of the critic a distinct impression
of the very processes by which his adventures were exaggerated
in his own memory as time elapsed. The three or four hundred
savages on the Potomac (Oxford Tract, p. 32, a sufficiently marvelous
story) rise to three or four thousand in the Generall Historie.
Pocahontas becomes the central figure in incidents as told
in 1624 in which she had no place in 1612. There is but one allusion
to Pocahontas in the entire Oxford Tract (p. 103), and that
has to do with the charge that Smith intended to marry her. A
just and witty judgment of Captain Smith was made almost in
his own time by Thomas Fuller. He says: "Such his perils,
preservations, dangers, deliverances, they seem to most men beyond
belief, to some beyond truth. Yet we have two witnesses
to attest them, the prose and the pictures, both in his own book;
and it soundeth much to the diminution of his deeds that he
alone is the herald to publish and proclaim them.... However,
moderate men must allow Captain Smith to have been very instrumental
in settling the plantation in Virginia, whereof he was
Governor, as also admiral of New England." Fuller's Worthies,
edition of 1840, i, 276. Those who desire to see an ingenious
and learned defense of Captain Smith, particularly in the matter
of the Pocahontas story, will find it in an address by Mr. William
Wirt Henry, published by the Virginia Historical Society. Prof.
Arber's discussion of the subject in his edition of Smith's Works
is sentimental rather than critical. Compare Deane's Wingfield
for the other side. Unnecessary heat has characterized some of
the debates about John Smith. History pitched in a shrill polemical
key is not instructive and is something less than amusing.
These debates center themselves on the Pocahontas story, which
is of little historical importance except as it involves the trustworthiness
of Smith's narrative.</p>

<p>The conduct of Captain Smith in the Virginia colony will be
better understood if we appreciate the character of his principal
opponent, Gabriel Archer. Archer's return to Virginia in 1609
and his agency in overthrowing Captain Smith are alluded to apparently
in a passage in the New Life of Virginea, 1612, "In
which distemper that envious man stept in, sowing plentifull
tares in the hearts of all," etc. One of Archer's schemes seems
to have been to establish a parliament and a complicated government
at the beginning. Purchas and Strachey both take sides
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>(p. 64)</span> against Archer in his controversy with Smith. Purchas, iv, p.
1749, Oxford Tract, 22. Wingfield warned Newport of the danger
of disturbance from Archer, who was "troubled with an ambitious
spirit." Wingfield's Discourse, 77, 94, 95. Wingfield
also says, "In all their disorders was Mr. Archer a ringleader."
He adds that Ratcliffe "did wear no other eies or eares than grew
on Mr. Archer's head." For a bibliographical account of Smith's
works the reader is referred to the valuable notes in Mr. Winsor's
Narrative and Critical History of America, vol. iii, <i>passim</i>.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b1_c2_4" name="anote_b1_c2_4"></a><a href="#note_b1_c2_4">Note 4, page 38.</a></span> A Trewe Relacyon, etc., at Petworth House, as above. The
Indians in sheer wantonness scraped out the brains of their
dead victims with mussel shells. Percy seems to have retaliated
in a way to exasperate without disabling the savages. He
"burned their hawses, Ransacked their Temples, tooke downe
the corpses off their deade Kings from off their Toambes [that is,
the scaffold on which their well-dried remains were deposited],
and caryed away their pearles, caps, and bracelets wherewith
they doe decore their Kings fvneralls." (For this sacred house
thus desecrated by Percy the Indians had such reverence that
none but priests and chiefs were allowed to enter, and the Indians
never ventured to pass it without casting some offering of
tobacco, wampum, copper, or puccoon root into the water.&mdash;Strachey,
90.) When Percy had captured a chief's wife and
children, the soldiers in revengeful wantonness, according to
Percy's account, threw the children out of the boat and shot
them in the water. The inefficient Percy was able to save the
life of the "queen" or chief's wife with difficulty. West and
Ratcliffe, who had overthrown Smith, are accused by Percy of
unnecessary cruelty to the savages. West sailed away in the
ship, leaving Jamestown to its fate. Ratcliffe was put to death
with exquisite tortures. There is no doubt some truth, as there is
certainly jealousy, in Percy's charge that Captain Smith was "an
ambitious, unworthy, and vainglorious fellow, attempting to take
all men's authorities from them," but he was neither weak, like
Percy and Ratcliffe, nor visionary, like the gold-hunting Martin
and the doctrinary and demagogical Archer, nor treacherous and
cruel, like West. With all his faults he only was master of the
situation in these early years. Percy admits that the lawful authority
was that of Smith. The history of the government of
Percy and his supporters seems to justify Smith's refusal to share
his lawful power with incompetent factionaries.</p>

adds that he caused the man to be tortured till he confessed, and
he relates repulsive details of the crime. The effrontery of an
official publication went so far as to deny (True Declaration,
1610), on the authority of Sir Thomas Gates, this fact so circumstantially
and abundantly attested. In Peckard's Life of
Ferrar, p. 158, a petition from the Virginia colony to the king is
preserved in which occur these words: "To tell how great things
many of us have suffered through hunger alone would be as incredible
as horrible for us to repeat to your sacred ears."</p>

in black letter, 1613, written by one of the party. Myriads
of birds nested on the island. How the hogs came to be there is
matter of conjecture. The writer of the Plaine Declaration makes
old Sir George Somers the resourceful hero of their marvelous
escape, and it was from him that the islands took the name of
Somers or Summer Islands. For want of pitch, the seams of the
vessels were paid with "a kind of hard lime" and some "wax
cast up by the sea." Strachey's A True Reportory of the Wracke
and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, etc., Purchas,
iv, p. 1734, is also by one of the shipwrecked party. The Rev.
Joseph Hunter has written with much learning, patient research,
and fatiguing prolixity to disprove the theory that Shakespeare's
Tempest was suggested by the wreck of Gates and Somers. He
succeeds in showing its relation to another occurrence, but works
of imagination do not usually have their origin in a single fact,
and it is hard to resist the conviction that the Tempest, as we
have it, contains more than one allusion to the wreck upon "the
still vexed Bermoothes."</p>

been noted. The communion table in Jamestown in De la Warr's
time was made of black walnut. The pews were of cedar, and
there were "fair, broad windows," with shutters of cedar, "to
shut and open as the weather shall occasion," but there appears
to have been no glass. Window glass was little used at that
time, and there probably was not a glazed window in the colony.
The pulpit was of cedar, and the font was "hewen hollow like a
canoa." Strachey, in Purchas, p. 1755.</p>

1624, manuscripts in the British Public Record Office, are the
most important authorities for the facts given in the text. The
Briefe Declaration is rather the fuller, but the earlier paper supplies
some particulars. These two formal documents are not
from the same hand, and the slight difference between them in
details tends rather to confirm than to shake the reader's confidence
in their testimony. The names of Sir Francis Wyatt,
George Sandys, and other prominent colonists appended to the
Tragicall Relation are a guarantee of its good faith. It is curious
to note that Raphe Hamor, whose relation is so favorable to
Dale, and who held the post of secretary under Dale and that of
vice-admiral under Argall, signs this paper, which is a severe
impeachment of Sir Thomas Smythe's administration of the affairs
of the company before 1619. Hamor's True Discourse has
heretofore usually been taken as an authority, but after reading
the documents in the Public Record Office one is compelled to
believe that Hamor, or perhaps one might say Dale, under cover
of his secretary, misrepresents the state of the colony, and makes
promises to those who may emigrate that it was hardly possible
to carry out. The Discourse of the old Virginia Company (Colonial
Papers, iii, 40), and other papers in the Public Record Office
relating to the strife between the company and the Court, throw
light on this period. The half-apologies for Dale's cruelties in
Smith's Generall Historie, book iv, prove their existence. "For
amongst them, so hardened in evil," says this writer, "the fear of
a cruel, painful, and unusual death more restrains them than
death itself." See also Hamor, p. 27. There is a letter from
Whitaker appended to Hamor's Discourse. Though apparently
an incidental letter, it bears marks of having been procured for
purposes of vindication. Its defensive tone goes to show that
the character of Dale's tyranny had transpired in England.
Whitaker praises Sir Thomas Dale mainly for being religious and
valiant, and says that he had "great knowledge in Divinity and
good conscience in all his doings; both which bee rare in a martiall
man." In Whitaker's Good Newes of Virginia, 1613, there
is no praise of Sir Thomas Dale. That Dale was famous for his
severity before he left Europe is manifest from the phrase used
by the Jesuit Biard, "Le Mareschal Thomas Deel que vous auez
ouy estre fort aspre en ses humeurs." Relation, chap. xxxiii.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>(p. 67)</span> See in this and the preceding chapter the whole account of his
savage temper toward his French prisoners, etc. It has been
the custom of our older writers to speak of Dale's administration
only in praise, but careful weighing of the original authorities
shows that Dale was utterly pitiless in the cruelty of his discipline
and unjust in his detention of the old planters, and that
when he left the colony he was more generally execrated than
any other man that ruled in these early days, not even excepting
his successor, Argall. Dale's severity was serviceable in carrying
the enterprise through straits, but the reports of his harshness
brought the colony into disrepute and checked immigration. The
detestation of Dale was shared by the best men in Virginia, yet it
is to be remembered that the savagery of Dale's government was
due not wholly to the brutal temper of the man, but partly to the
age and the school in which he had been bred. Legal torture was
in use long after this. The Clarendon Papers, quoted by Southey,
state that at Henley-on-Thames, as late as 1646, it was ordered
that a woman's tongue should be nailed to a tree for complaining
of the tax levied by Parliament. The cruel practices of the agents
of the Virginia Company are paralleled by those of the East India
Company at the same time. "Before they were intrusted
with martial law they made it a rule to whip to death or starve
to death those of whom they wished to get rid." Mills, British
India, i, 38. Even that champion of popular liberty, Sir Edwin
Sandys, found it in his heart to approve of Dale's course while
admitting its harshness. He said to the court of the Virginia
Company of the 17th of November, 1619, that "Sir Thomas Dale,
building upon these foundations with great and constant severity,
reclaymed almost miraculously those idle and disordered people,
and reduced them to labor and an honest fashion of life." MS.

interesting manuscript in the British Record Office, makes it appear
that as late as 1618 the colonists had no thought of staying
in Virginia, and even the directors at home were interested only
in making money out of tobacco and sassafras, with little or no
care to plant a permanent colony. Some allowance must be
made, perhaps, for the <i>ex-parte</i> nature of this paper, but its tone

these details, though the book generally is discredited by the

signed with others in 1623. A comparison of all these authorities

"farmers" derived any benefit from Dale's three-acre division,

for his government under shew of a new plantation to be

in time of defence by war), were exempted from all power, authority,

this necessity for some present support came the great lottery.
It was recommended by the Privy Council to the Mayor of Canterbury,
February 22, 1615. There was a "running lottery" of
smaller adventures in Paul's Churchyard before the "great standing
lottery" was instituted, and then there were other "running
lotteries" "in many other places after." Purchas, p. 1773. No
doubt there were corruptions and abuses in these lotteries. The
merchants prospered while Virginia languished. Its unpopularity
is attributed to "malignant tongues," in the MS. Records of the

Charter of November 13, 1618, by a minute in the handwriting
of Secretary Williamson in the Public Record Office, as follows:
"Those Adventurers &amp; Planters by Vertue of y<sup>e</sup> s<sup>d</sup> Lett<sup>rs</sup> Patent
of Incorpora&#269;on &amp;c. made a Great charter of Lawes &amp; Ord<sup>rs</sup> for
y<sup>e</sup> govermn<sup>t</sup> of the Country. It bore date at London, Nov. 13<sup>th</sup>
1618." Col. Pprs, i, 11. The proceedings of the first Assembly
in Virginia are preserved in the Public Record Office in
Pory's Report. This report gives the only information we have
regarding the provisions of this long-lost charter. An abstract
of these proceedings is printed in the Calendar of Colonial Documents,
and the whole document was reprinted in the New York
Historical Society Collections, second series, vol. iii, and yet more
carefully in the Colonial Records of Virginia, 1874. There is an
allusion to this charter in the Briefe Relation, 1624. Various
Virginia land grants deduce their authority from the Great Charter
of Laws and Orders of November 13, 1618, as we learn from
a note in the Aspinwall Papers, p. 14. There are many allusions
to the charter of 1618 in the Manuscript Records of the Virginia
Company in the Library of Congress.</p>

Dale reigned was edited and published by Strachey in 1612, and
reprinted in Force's Tracts, vol. iii. This code appears to have
had no other sanction than the approval of Sir Thomas Smythe,
the governor of the company. The beneficial effect of these laws
is maintained in Hamor's Discourse, in Rolfe's Relation, and in
certain letters of Dale in the Record Office. It was not, indeed,
the government by martial law, but Dale's abuse of his power,
that wrought the mischief. After the emancipation the old settlers
lived in perpetual terror lest some turn of the wheel should
put them once more in the power of Sir Thomas Smythe and his
divine and martial laws. See especially the Additional Statement
appended to the Discourse of the Old Virginia Company. On the
long and bitter dissension that resulted in the overthrow of the
company, see Arthur Woodnoth's Short Collection of the most
remarkable Passages from the Original to the Dissolution of the
Virginia Company, a rare work of great value to the historian of
this period.</p>

brought also the news of the election of Sandys and John Ferrar.
But Yeardley arrived in Virginia on the 18th of April (O.S.), and
Sir Thomas Smythe's resignation did not take place until ten days
later. Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company. The news
that Sir George Yeardley did bring was no doubt that the power
of Sir Thomas Smythe and his party was broken, and that the
actual control of affairs was in the hands of such men as Sandys,
Southampton, Cavendish, Danvers, and the two Ferrars. The
whole policy of the company indicates that the new party was
really in power, and the appointment of such a man as Yeardley
was probably the work of the rising party. The records before
the resignation of Sir Thomas Smythe were probably destroyed
for purposes of concealment.</p>

Letter to the Governor and Council by the ship Marmaduke,
August 12, 1621. A proposal to send women had been made
seven years earlier. Commons Journal, 1, 487, May 17, 1614.
Extract from Martyn's Speech (for which he was reprimanded):
"That they require but a few honest Labourers burthened with
Children.&mdash;Moveth, a committee may consider of the means for
this, for Seven Years; at which some of the Company may be
present." On November 17, 1619, Sir Edwin Sandys pointed
out in the court of the company that the people of Virginia
"were not settled in their mindes to make it their place of rest
and continuance." "For the remedying of the Mischiefe and
for establishing a perpetuitie of the Plantation," he proposed the
sending of "one hundred young maides to become wives." Manuscript
Records of the Virginia Company, i, 44, 45. Two women,
the first in the colony, had arrived in September, 1608. Oxford
Tract, 47. There were women in Gates's party in 1610. It was
even reported that some English women had intermingled with
the natives. Calendar Colonial Papers, i, 13. An allowance of food
to women in De la Warr's time is proof that women were there.
In 1629 there was living Mistress Pearce, "an honest, industrious
woman," who had been in Virginia "near twenty years." Rolfe
(a copy of whose Relation is among the Duke of Manchester's
MSS. now in the British Public Record Office) sets down a remainder
of seventy-five of the three hundred and fifty-one persons
in the colony at Dale's departure, as women and children. It is
worth recalling here that D'Ogeron, who governed Santo Domingo
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>(p. 72)</span> in 1663 and after, supplied the buccaneers with wives
brought from France; and the plan was also put into practice in
Louisiana about a century later than the Virginia experiment, and
the same expedient, as is well known, was resorted to in Canada.
In Virginia more pains were taken to have all the women thus
imported of a good character than in some of the French colonies.</p>

going is probably erroneous (see the speech of Sandys, July 7,
1620, Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company). He says,
"These people (including the maids) are to be provided as they
have formerly beene, partlie by printed publication of the supplies
indicated, together with the conditions offered to these publique
tennants, partlie by help of such noble friends and others in remote
parts as have formerlie given great assistance." The notion
that some of the maidens were pressed seems to have had its rise
in the counterfeiting of the great seal and the issuing of forged
commissions to press maidens for "breeders for the King" in the
Bermudas and Virginia in order to extort money. One Owen
Evans was accused of such practices in October, 1618 (Sainsbury,
p. 19), and one Robinson was hanged, drawn, and quartered
for this or similar offences in November of the same year (Birch's
Court of James I, 108). In order to encourage the adventurers
or shareholders to subscribe to the sending of maids, a town was
laid off in Virginia to be called Maydstown. The subscribers
were to be allowed shares in this town. Manuscript Records,

of Congress, which I refer to in these notes as Manuscript Book
of Instructions, pp. 76 and 89. I may remark here that this
book has not been in use in recent times for reference. Its origin
is uncertain, nor can the authorities of the library tell where it
came from. It was compiled in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, judging from internal evidence, and was perhaps kept
among the records of the colony for reference on what we should
call constitutional questions. I found a loose memorandum laid
in its pages in the handwriting of Thomas Jefferson, to whom the
book probably once belonged.</p>

<span class="smcap"><i>THE PROCESSION OF MOTIVES.</i></span></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The chief mistake.</span> The cause of the sorrows of Virginia will be
more plainly seen if we turn again to the motives
that propelled Englishmen to plant a colony. The
chief mistake lay in the main purpose. If the
founding of a state had been other than a secondary
and remote end, the managers might have sent
at first families and not bachelors, farmers and not
gentlemen, laborers and not riff-raff. But more
visionary motives dominated the action. A state
was planted, but something else was mainly intended
by the first projectors. The work seemed
continuous, but the end in view shifted and the
actors gradually changed. The only motive that
held from first to last, and ran through all the rest,
was the rivalry with Spain.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The rivalry with Spain.</span> The colonies attempted by Frobisher and Gilbert
were to serve as relays in the work of exploration
for a sea passage to the Pacific and the search
for mines, but they mark strongly the influence of
the Spanish example on English projects. Ralegh
was a lifelong opponent in peace and war of Spanish
intrigue and aggression, and his efforts to plant
colonies in the virgin land were suggested by a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name="page74"></a>(p. 74)</span> knowledge of the almost exhaustless treasure that
flowed into Spanish coffers from America. The opportune
capture of a Spanish carack bound homeward
from Mexico with letters describing the wealth
of Mexican mines brought the support of English
merchants to Ralegh's undertaking. Imbued with
the same spirit, Ralegh's governor wrote from
Roanoke Island in 1585 that his colony would be
a means of deliverance from the domination of
Spain, "whose strength doth altogether grow
from the mines of her treasure." <span class="sidenote">Lane to Sydney. Aug. 12, 1585. Sainsbury.</span> In the perilous
isolation of the little company on Roanoke Island,
Lane assures himself that God will feed his men
by means of ravens rather than suffer their "enemies
the papists" "to triumph at the overthrow
of this most Christian action." <span class="sidenote">Lane to Walsingham. Aug. 12, 1585. Sainsbury.</span> The home-staying
English of that age were spurred to colony-planting
by three main motives&mdash;cupidity, patriotic feeling,
and religious zeal&mdash;and all of these were provoked
by emulation and jealousy of Spain.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_1" name="note_b1_c3_1"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_1">Note 1.</a></span></p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Delusions in colony-planting.</span> The prolonged movement for a colonial establishment,
which extended over the latter half of
the reign of Elizabeth and almost the whole of the
reign of James I, was kept alive by delusions. The
ultimate ends for which colonies were proposed
and planted in the last quarter of the sixteenth
and the first quarter of the seventeenth century
were none of them attained. The movable passage
through North America to the Pacific was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page75" name="page75"></a>(p. 75)</span> still leading explorers a merry dance when the
first Jamestown emigrants sailed in 1606, and gold
mines of comminuted mica, of iron pyrites, of Indian
mineral paints, and of pure fable were potent
attractions for some time after. The gradual increase
of geographical knowledge caused the
"South Sea" to take shelter in the unknown region
behind the mountains, and the gold mines
reported by Indians and discovered by sanguine
prospectors were somehow lost in the interminable
forests. In this exigency the first colony must
have perished for want of support if new hopes
as illusive as the old had not moved the English
people to avert such a calamity.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Commodities.</span> The production of commodities which the ungenial
climate of the British Islands refused to
grow was thought of from the beginning, and they
became after 1616 the main hope of wealth from
Virginia. <span class="sidenote">For example, Carlisle's treatise, Anderson's Commerce,
year 1583.</span> It seemed grievous that England should
spend her money in buying wine and silk from
southern Europe and naval stores from the Baltic.
The only maxim of political economy generally
accepted in that day was that a nation is enriched
by getting money from abroad and keeping it at
home. The precious metals constituted the only
recognized riches. Laws were made to restrain
the exportation of gold and silver, and sumptuary
laws to discourage the consumption of those things
that must be bought of the foreigner. Efforts to
raise in Great Britain the products of the Mediterranean
region would have proved successful if the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>(p. 76)</span> climate had been half as favorable to such enterprises
as the government. <span class="sidenote">Wine.</span> The arguments advanced
in favor of the possibility of producing
wine in England did much, no doubt, to secure the
sunshine of royal favor for experiments made to
that end, but climatic conditions were inexorable.
King James busied himself to no profit in raising
mulberry trees and nursing a private stock of silkworms,
in imitation of Henry IV, the reigning
King of France, who succeeded in producing cocoons
in the Tuileries but not in making silk
culture profitable in the north of France. <span class="sidenote">Silk.</span> <span class="sidenote">Anderson on the year 1589.</span> Mulberries
were first planted in England in 1608, two
years after the sailing of the Virginia argonauts.
James sent circulars to persons of influence among
his subjects asking them to cultivate mulberry
trees, and, in the years immediately following, the
silk fever ran its course alongside the excitement
about the great lottery in behalf of the Virginia
colony. <span class="sidenote">1609.</span> Hakluyt, spreading sails for America in
every breeze, hastened to announce at the first
mention of silk culture that mulberry trees, "apt to
feed silke wormes to make silke," were a "chiefe
commoditie" of Virginia.</p>

<p>The first principles that govern colony-planting
were not yet understood. It was proposed to force
everything from a forlorn camp of men dwelling
under roofs of bark and sedge, environed by treacherous
foes and in constant peril of starvation. The
raising of silkworms was begun in Virginia in 1613,
and before the colony was nine years old it was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page77" name="page77"></a>(p. 77)</span> able to send to England silk that doubtless had
cost more than a hundred times its market value.
The experiment came to nothing. It could not
have happened otherwise amid the miseries of
those early years. The rats, which opportunely
destroyed the eggs of the silk moth, were made to
bear the responsibility for the failure.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A new silk fever.</span> Silk was little known in England at the beginning
of Elizabeth's reign, but it came into great
request a few years later. <span class="sidenote">Cal. Dom. S. P. James I, p. 428.</span> In 1617 Lord Carew
declares that there is "a madness for silk instead
of cloth." This rage for silk led to the establishment
of silk manufacturing in England; throwsters,
dyers, and weavers were brought to England
from abroad and settled in Spitalfields, "the
cheap end of its metropolis," and in Moorfields.
It seemed more than ever important to produce
silk in the king's dominions, in order to supply
these manufacturers with material without importation
from alien lands. Accordingly, a new effort
was made in 1620 to secure raw silk from Virginia.
The Earl of Southampton, ever eager to promote
the Virginia colony, "writt into Italy, France, and
Spayne" for silkworm "seed"; the king gave
some from his own stock, and the expert who had
charge of the king's worms was sent over to look
after the business. A French book on the subject
was translated to instruct the colonists. <span class="sidenote">Pory's Report, Pub. Rec. Off.</span> The
first Virginia Assembly in 1619 had passed a law
to promote the raising of the mulberry. To save
expense, the colonists at this time, or later, planted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page78" name="page78"></a>(p. 78)</span> the trees in hedgerows and mowed them with a
scythe. <span class="sidenote">Phil. Trans. I, 201.</span> In 1621 orders were sent from England
that none but members of the Council and the
heads of hundreds should wear silk, unless they
had made it themselves. <span class="sidenote">Hening i, 14.</span> The prohibition shows
how general was the craze for silk clothing. <span class="sidenote">Original Records of Colony of Va.</span> The
climate of Virginia proved genial enough, but the
massacre of 1622, the bitter Indian conflicts that
ensued in 1623, and the epidemic of the same year,
following one another swiftly, were enough to annihilate
a hundred feeble projects. The real doom
of silk-raising, however, came from the fact that
the culture of tobacco in virgin soil was incalculably
more profitable and vastly less troublesome
to pioneers than hatching silkworms' eggs in one's
pocket or bosom, or sleeping with them in a small
box under one's bolster and covering them in the
warm bed on rising.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_2" name="note_b1_c3_2"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_2">Note 2.</a></span> The project was blighted
in the bud by adverse economic conditions&mdash;a
killing frost more deadly to such enterprises than
an ungenial climate. But a lesson in economic
principles is one of the hardest for men to learn.
Long after the colony had become prosperous,
English projectors and Virginia experimenters
tried again and again to supplant tobacco with
silk. If we may credit the report, Virginia furnished
a coronation robe of silk for Charles I,
and Charles II certainly wore silk from worms
hatched and fed in his Virginia dominions. One
Esquire Digges brought Armenians to Virginia to
attend his worms. <span class="sidenote">1655.</span> But in the Reformed Virginia
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page79" name="page79"></a>(p. 79)</span> Silkworm, by Hartlib, the friend of Milton, it is
announced that a young lady had discovered that
silkworms would care for themselves on the trees,
"to the instant wonderful enrichment of all the
planters there, requiring neither cost, labour, or
hindrance in any of their other employments." It
is also suggested on the eager title-page of the
pamphlet that "the Indians, seeing and finding
that there is neither Art, Pains, or Skill in the
thing," will "incontinently fall to raising silk."
<span class="sidenote">Comp. Va. Richly Valued, 1650, and Leah and Rachel,
1636.</span> Not only were the gentle savages, and especially
their women and children, to devote themselves to
silk, but the American caterpillar&mdash;"the natural
silkworm" as it was called&mdash;was expected to spin
for the market if his cocoon could be "refined."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_3" name="note_b1_c3_3"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_3">Note 3.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hening ii, 242.</span> By 1666 the silk delusion had passed, and the
Virginia Assembly repealed all acts for the encouragement
of mulberry trees. Ten years later,
Glover, the botanist, found many of these trees
still standing as melancholy witnesses to the waste
of energy by the earlier promoters and settlers of
the colony. <span class="sidenote">Phil. Trans. XI, 628.</span> Almost every other American colony
made the same experiment for itself, and Virginia
renewed its endeavors from time to time, each
generation forgetting what its fathers had learned.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Silk-grass.</span> Along with the silk fever went the silk-grass
craze. <span class="sidenote">1585.</span> Ralegh's people had seen the Indians
wearing garments woven of the fiber of the <i>Yucca
filamentosa</i>, the "Adam's needle and thread" of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>(p. 80)</span> our popular speech. <span class="sidenote">A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of
Virginia.</span> Hariot, in his account of it,
declares that "the like grows in Persia," and that
much of the "silk-works" coming thence to
Europe was made of this fiber. He probably
confounded the yucca with the ramie plant of the
East, of which grass cloth is made. Of the yucca
fiber taken to England in 1585, "a piece of silk
grogram" was made, and of course pronounced
"excellent good"; it was even presented to the
queen. The coarse and rather brittle fiber of this
plant was exalted by enthusiasts into something
nearly equal to silk. Ordinances for planting it
were sent from England; at least one legislative
act in its favor was passed by the Virginia Assembly,
and the most foolish hopes were entertained
regarding the profit to be had from it. <span class="sidenote">Proceedings of Va. Assembly, 1619. 2d N. Y. Hist.
Society Coll. iii, 348.</span> By 1619 it
had come to be called "silk flax," and it was then
advocated for homelier uses, such as cordage and
linen, and every householder was compelled by
law to set a hundred plants; the governor himself
set five thousand. In 1624 it is spoken of as "a
commoditie of speciall hope and much use."
<span class="sidenote">Purchas IV, p. 1777.</span> There were by this time those who ventured to
say that the silk-grass enterprise was "full of difficultie";
but the managers in England easily got
rid of this objection by attributing the difficulty
to "negligence and want of experience." <span class="sidenote">Instr. of 24 July, 1624. MS. Bk. of Instr. Libr. of
Cong.</span> They
were just then intent on finding some commodity
that would take the place of tobacco, which was
frowned upon by both court and Parliament. In
spite of all discouragement, the hope of good results
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>(p. 81)</span> from the yucca fiber outlasted that generation,
and was in full vigor in 1649, sixty-four years
after Hariot's mistake.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wine.</span> It was also proposed to produce wine in Virginia
for English consumption. No more gold
and silver should go out of the realm to buy port
and canary to the profit of foreigners and the impoverishment
of the good and loyal subjects of his
Majesty. The instructions on this point were clear,
and before the Virginia exiles had secured bread
to stay their hunger they had made wine of the
sour wild grapes of the country. French vine-dressers
were sent over a little later and were forbidden
to plant tobacco, but were compelled to
employ themselves about vines, with the care of
silkworms for variety. <span class="sidenote">MS. Rec. Va. Co. i, 343.</span> In 1621 these Frenchmen
sent to England a cask of wine, the arrival of which
was duly celebrated. Other experimental casks of
wine were afterward sent to England from America
at long intervals, but without decreasing the profits
of wine growers in the Old World.</p>

<p>All the commodities sought from Virginia were
unsuited to conditions in a new country. <span class="sidenote">Other products sought.</span> To the
folly of making such experiments at all where living
itself was an experiment, the managers added
the folly of crowding a multiplicity of problematic
enterprises on the colony at the same time. With
a virgin continent in which to produce novelties,
all things seemed possible in an age so hopeful.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>(p. 82)</span> Plants of every clime grew rank in the imagination
of projectors. Virginia was a wonderland,
and it was readily believed without evidence that
the "soyle and clymate" were "very apt and fit
for sugar canes"; "also linseed and rapeseeds to
make oiles," as a black-letter pamphlet of 1609 expresses
it. <span class="sidenote">Nova Brittania.</span> Along with "orenges, limons, and almonds,"
this official writer proposes to plant "anniseeds,
rice, cummin, cottonwool, carroway seeds,
ginger, madder, olives, oris, sumacke," and, as if
this breathless list were not enough for one new
land, he adds, "and many such like that I can not
now name." If we may trust the publications of
the company, various West India plants were tried
in the very first days of the colony, while the threefold
peril of death from famine, pestilence, and savage
war was imminent.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Timber and naval stores.</span> But it was not enough to wring from an infant
colony the products of the south; those derived
from the north of Europe were straightway to
be got there also. <span class="sidenote">MS. Rec. Va. Co. 31 May and 23 June, 1620.</span> German millwrights&mdash;"Dutch
carpenters," in the phrase of the records&mdash;were
brought from Hamburg by John Ferrar to build
Virginia sawmills; timber was still sawed by hand
in England. Pitch, tar, and potash were to be
produced by Poles sent out for the purpose in the
second year of the colony. Patriotism dictated
that England should be relieved of her dependence
on foreign countries for naval stores. Virginia
had forests: why should she not produce these
things? <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_4" name="note_b1_c3_4"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_4">Note 4.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>(p. 83)</span> It had been found that the savages eagerly received
glass beads in exchange for corn and peltries. <span class="sidenote">Glass-making.</span>
Nothing more was required to prove the
profitableness of glass-making. Some Germans
were sent to the colony in 1608, and glass works
were established. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_5" name="note_b1_c3_5"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_5">Note 5.</a></span> For some reason no proper materials
were available at first, and it became necessary
to request that sand might be sent from
England to make Virginia glass of at the glass
works in the woods near Jamestown. The German
glass blowers were prone to run away to the
Indians, among whom work was lighter and food
more abundant. The tribesmen encouraged these
desertions by providing dusky wives for the men
whose skill with tools and weapons they valued
highly. In 1621 the glass business was revived,
and this time it was intrusted to Italian workmen.
<span class="sidenote">Iron works.</span> About the same time iron works were established
at Falling Creek, with "forty skilled workmen from
Sussex to carry them forward." <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_6" name="note_b1_c3_6"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_6">Note 6.</a></span> Twenty-five ship
carpenters were sent to ply their trade on the
James River, and it was also arranged that oil was
to be distilled from walnuts by the "apothecaries."
George Sandys was sent over in July, 1621, to have
entire control of all schemes for staple commodities.
There was a certain fitness in intrusting these
creatures of the imagination to a poet. Pineapples,
plantains, and other fruits were to be started
forthwith. There was once again great hope from
the "rich commodity of silk," an endowed school
for Indians was founded, and the little Virginia
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>(p. 84)</span> pool became iridescent with many frail bubbles.
<span class="sidenote">Result of the massacre.</span> The sudden and frightful massacre by the savages
in March, 1622, obliterated instantly all vain and
premature projects. This calamity did not cause
the failure of these foredoomed schemes; it only
saved them from a painful and lingering death, and
provided their friends with a decent epitaph for
them. The people who survived the massacre
were decimated by an epidemic in the following
year. What strength they could spare from frequent
battles with the savages they spent in growing
corn and tobacco, which last, of all the things
tried, proved to be the only commodity profitable
for export.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tobacco.</span> Against tobacco King James had written a
book. <span class="sidenote">A Covnter-Blaste to Tobacco, 1604.</span> It was denounced in Parliament and regarded
by all public-spirited men as an evil. Nevertheless,
it turned the scale and saved the colony.
In colony-planting the problem is fundamentally an
economic one, and economic problems are solved
by coarse and homely means. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_7" name="note_b1_c3_7"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_7">Note 7.</a></span> John Rolfe, the
first Englishman that ventured to wed an Indian,
planted the first tobacco at Jamestown in 1612, and
by 1616 the better West India variety had perhaps
been substituted for the harsh kind grown by the
Virginia Indians, and by them called "uppowoc"
or "apooke." Tobacco prospered and was profitable,
to the disgust of the pedantic king and the
sorrow of all who had cherished hopes of beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>(p. 85)</span> products from a colony upon which so much poetic
sentiment had been lavished. Neither gold
nor spices came as had been expected; the strings
of pearls seen by Ralegh's men were not again to
be found, or were perhaps transformed on investigation
into wampum beads; the silver mine once
discovered on the upper James had vanished forever;
tropical fruits refused to grow; even madder
and woad failed, and, though the indigo plant
would readily mature, nobody knew how to manufacture
the dye. Silk was troublesome and unprofitable,
shipbuilding, and such coarse but patriotic
products as naval stores had come to naught.
But the detestable "weed," as King James had
dubbed it, throve apace. As early as 1617 the
waste margins of the broad streets of Jamestown
were planted with it by the eager settlers.
The English merchants grasped at the profits
of it, the farmers of the customs rejoiced in the
heavy duties imposed on it, and a powerful mercenary
interest in the prosperity of Virginia was
established. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_8" name="note_b1_c3_8"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_8">Note 8.</a></span> By 1624, when the Virginia Company
was dissolved, the danger that the colony
would be abandoned as a result of Spanish intrigues,
Indian massacres, or prolonged discouragement
had passed away. Public spirit, patriotism,
and religious enthusiasm no longer guarded
it as a feeble house plant. It had struck root in
the outdoor soil of human self-interest and its life
was assured. From that time the colony that had
been for seventeen years a fairyland to dreamers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>(p. 86)</span> in England and a perdition to its inhabitants, became
a sober money-making enterprise, uninteresting
to enthusiasts and philanthropists. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_9" name="note_b1_c3_9"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_9">Note 9.</a></span></p>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Motives of sentiment.</span> In the preceding sections of this chapter we
have traced what may be called the series of commercial
motives that, sometimes in succession,
often in co-operation, propelled the Virginia movement.
The agitation for a colony was primarily
a commercial one. The London or Virginia Company
by which it was carried forward had been
organized in the form of the great trading corporations
of the time, such as the Muscovy Company
and the East India Company, and it was
expected to yield large returns. But though commercial
in form and purpose, the Virginia Company
from the outset was able to appeal successfully
in every emergency to motives that were far
from mercenary. Into the chain-threads of commercial
enterprise was woven a woof of patriotic
feeling and religious sentiment.</p>


<h4>VII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rise of the patriot party in the Virginia Company.</span> Dale's empty-handed return, and Argall's homecoming
with hands full of the spoil of both colony
and colonists, were severe blows to the hope of
profit from Virginia, and thereafter commercial
motives fell to a second place. The company
began to pass more and more out of the control
of traders like Sir Thomas Smyth and Alderman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>(p. 87)</span> Johnson, and the corrupt clique of predatory merchants,
as well as out of the reach of voracious
noblemen like Warwick. More and more it passed
into the hands of the great liberal statesmen whose
leader was the incorruptible Sir Edwin Sandys, a
man of rare gifts and knowledge and of great resoluteness.
These men had suffered some disappointment,
no doubt, in their struggle for parliamentary
freedom in England. They might have
succeeded better had their antagonist been a
strong king, but against the pusillanimity, the vanity,
the vacillation, and the pedantic dogmatism of
James little permanent headway could be made.
Without relinquishing the conflict in the House of
Commons, they took it up in the Quarter Courts
of the Virginia Company. In this new field they
found themselves afresh confronted by the obstinacy
of the king, who was stirred up to oppose
them by the discarded governor, Sir Thomas
Smyth, and his friends, by Warwick, and by all
the partisans of high prerogative and all the advocates
of the Spanish match. <span class="sidenote">Woodnoth's Short Collection, p. 6.</span> "Bedchamber men"
and others about the king's person were engaged
to work upon the king to come to the rescue of
Sir Thomas Smyth's "honor." <span class="sidenote">Peckard's Ferrar, 113.</span> The Spanish ambassador
Gondomar, who had spies in the Virginia
Company, took pains to feed James's discontent.
He told the king that it was time for him to look
into the Virginia courts, which were held in the
great hall of the house of the Ferrar family. Too
many of the king's nobility and gentry resorted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88"></a>(p. 88)</span> thither, in order to be in company with the popular
Lord Southampton and the dangerous Sandys.
They were deep politicians, and they entertained
designs beyond a tobacco plantation. Their leaders,
he said, were "subtle men of high courage
who regarded neither his master nor their own."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sir Edwin Sandys.</span> Sandys, as assistant to Sir Thomas Smyth and
virtual governor, had already succeeded in establishing
in Virginia a constitutional state with a
representative government. <span class="sidenote">Royal Hist. MS. Comm. viii, II, 45.</span> He was furthering
plans for the foundation of the little separatist
state of New Plymouth, and his enemies set agoing
tales that he had dark designs of removing
with the Pilgrims to America, in order to found a
democratic state there. In 1619 Sir Thomas
Smyth tendered his resignation, and the company,
to his surprise, it would appear, accepted it, and
chose Sandys to his place. When, in 1620, his
first year of government drew to a close, Sir
Edwin Sandys erected an elegant ballot-box in the
midst of the hall of the Ferrars, that the brilliant
assemblage of noblemen, knights, gentlemen, and
merchants might by a secret vote exercise the
right of choice without any constraint. <span class="sidenote">The king's interference.</span> Just as
the assemblage was about to begin voting, two
clerks of the signet were announced with a message
from the king forbidding the company to
choose Sandys. <span class="sidenote">1620.</span> "Choose the devil, if you will,
but not Sir Edwin Sandys," was one form in which
the king expressed his aversion. Southampton,
braving the king's displeasure, allowed himself to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page89" name="page89"></a>(p. 89)</span> be elected, with Sandys for deputy. In June, 1621,
both Southampton and Sandys were imprisoned. <span class="sidenote">A land of freedom.</span>
This attracted attention to Virginia as a "refuge
from a more oppressive government in England."
In three months' time twenty-five ships set sail for
the colony, which gained an impetus from the
king's opposition that put it beyond the danger
of destruction by the calamities of the next two
years. Even before the massacre and pestilence
of 1622 and 1623, Southampton was assured by
friends at court that it would come to "push of
pike," and that the company would be overthrown.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_10" name="note_b1_c3_10"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_10">Note 10.</a></span>
The charter of the company was vacated
in 1624, but free government had so taken
root in the colony that it could never afterward be
quite extirpated. A new English state with a
popular government had been founded of deliberate
purpose by a group of English statesmen, at
the head of which, and easily first, was Sir Edwin
Sandys, whose great service to the people and nation
that were to come has been almost forgotten.</p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Religious propagandism.</span> We shall not have taken a just account of Virginia
colonization if we do not reckon religious
motives among the many forces that carried that
wavering enterprise to success. From the excitement
about American exploration and colonization
the English church caught its first missionary
impulse. The Indian captives brought from
America at various times gave to Englishmen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>(p. 90)</span> the novel sight of men and women from beyond
the bounds of Christendom; people who had never
been baptized, and had never learned to wear English
garments, "naked slaves of the devil," as one
of the early Virginia clergymen described them.
To the benevolent desire of Englishmen for the
deliverance of the savages from devil-worship and
semi-nudity, there was added the natural wish for
ecclesiastical extension. The separation of England
from the Roman hierarchy had been a blow
to the aspiration for an unattainable catholicity
cherished in one form or another by Christian
ecclesiastics of almost every school. It was not
possible that the great men who were leaders of
the English church in the reigns of Elizabeth and
James should be content with the narrow limits of
"the little English paddock," while Spanish conquerors
and missionary priests were winning for
the Roman communion a new and vast dominion
in America. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b1_c3_11" name="note_b1_c3_11"></a><a href="#anote_b1_c3_11">Note 11.</a></span> English ecclesiastics felt keenly the
reproach made against them by the Roman Catholics
that they were not "converters of infidels."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Zeal of the clergy.</span> Perhaps the earliest of all Anglican missionaries
was Robert Hunt, the first minister in Virginia,
a light shining in a dark place indeed. He
bore with unfaltering courage and a sweet-hearted
patience rarely equaled in the history of martyrdom
the accumulating miseries of Jamestown, until
he also perished in the general mortality. His
nobleness of spirit softened the detestable rivalries
of the early leaders. The most active and influential
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>(p. 91)</span> writers in favor of colonization were clergymen
such as Hakluyt, Symonds, Purchas, and
Crashaw. Other clergymen, following in the footsteps
of Hunt, risked life itself in the Virginia colony,
while devout laymen spent their money in its
behalf. Thus did Anglican zeal further a colonization
that, by a curious perversity of outcome,
resulted in founding a nation of dissenters.</p>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Ferrars.</span> In the great hall of the house of Nicholas Ferrar,
a London merchant, the courts or meetings of
the Virginia Company were held for years. The
two sons of this Nicholas Ferrar, John and Nicholas,
served in turn as deputy governors of the Virginia
Company. This pious Ferrar family, as it
became influential, lent to the scheme of colonizing
Virginia something of the air of a project for propagating
the gospel. Nicholas, the father, gave
money for the education of infidels in Virginia. A
school was founded there by the gifts of the pious,
and rewards were given to those colonists who
would educate Indian children in their families.
After the younger Nicholas, who was a man of
remarkable zeal and activity, tinged with a romantic
enthusiasm, became deputy in 1622, the production
of silk and wine and iron and the educating
of Indians in Christianity traveled on abreast.
A college was proposed, for which an endowment
of thirteen hundred pounds was collected, and to
which a valuable library was bequeathed by a settler.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>(p. 92)</span> Practical men grumbled at the prematurity
of all this, and complained of those in charge
that "they spent Michaelmas rent in mid-summer
moone." The governor of the colony, honest Sir
Francis Wyatt, wished that "little Mr. Ferrar
were in Virginia, where he might add to his zeal
a knowledge of the country."</p>

<p>The horrible massacre of March, 1622, made the
Indian question something other than the Ferrars
saw it. All schemes for educating the savages
were obliterated in a day. The only thought after
this was how to put the savages to death, old and
young, men and women, more often by foul means
than by fair. The settlers even emulated, if they
did not surpass, the treachery of the Indians.
With the dissolution of the company by <i>quo warranto</i>
proceedings in 1624 the government of the
colony passed to the Crown, and the Ferrars had
no more to do with Virginia.</p>

<h4>X.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Later History of the Ferrars.</span> The later career of Nicholas Ferrar the younger,
though without direct relation to colonization,
throws light on the age of colony beginnings.
Rejecting the offer of a rich bride, he bought for
his mother, now a widow, the manor lordship of
Little Gidding, in Huntingdonshire, and took the
entire Ferrar family, including his brother and his
sister with eighteen children, into religious retirement.
Here this half-domestic, half-monastic community
gave alms to the poor, illuminated manuscripts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>(p. 93)</span> of the Bible, and worshiped in its little
chapel with genuflections and other observances
that procured for it the nickname of the "Protestant
Nunnery," and brought down upon it the
pious fury of the Puritans. Nicholas Ferrar, who
had taken deacon's orders, was the real head of
the community. He prepared at Little Gidding
what is perhaps the earliest English monatesseron
of the four gospels. By means of relays of worshipers
the Ferrars kept their devotions always
in progress. The entire Psalter was chanted antiphonally
during each twenty-four hours. Those
whose turn it was to keep vigil were wont to leave
a candle at the door of Nicholas and to wish him
good-morrow at one o'clock in the morning, at
which hour he was accustomed to rise and begin
the exercises of the day. The strength of this
belated mediæval saint gave way under a discipline
so austere, and he died in 1637. <span class="sidenote">Peckard's Life of N. Ferrar.</span>

a few years later by the counter-zeal of the Puritans,

a certain refined beauty, but it was hardly suited
to the rough work of hewing a road along which
civilization might march into a savage wilderness.
The Puritans, with their robust contempt for æsthetic
considerations&mdash;making firewood of organs
with delight, and feasting without scruple on the

much the fitter to be champions against the
American Canaanites.</p>

those cited in the text and the margin, are too numerous to find
place here. The most valuable of all is, of course, the copy of
the Records of the Virginia Company after April, 1619, in the
Library of Congress, <i>passim</i>. See, for example, under date of
December 13, 1620, and June 11, 1621. See also A Declaration
of Virginia, 1620, and Purchas, pp. 1777-1787, Hamor's True

with Sainsbury's preface to the first volume of his Calendar,
and Hening, <i>passim</i>. The reader is also referred to Mr. Bruce's
Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century, issued
as these pages are passing into the hands of the printer. The
wildness of some of the proposals for the production of Virginia
silk in the Commonwealth period is almost surpassed by other
projects of the time. In Virginia Richly Valued, 1650, perfume
was to be extracted from the muskrat, and the James River
sturgeon were to be domesticated. Fishes may be "unwilded,"
says the author. Besides feeding silkworms, the Indians were to
be used in pearl fisheries in Virginia waters. Wyckoff on Silk
Manufacture, Tenth Census, says that experimental silkworms
had been taken to Mexico by the Spaniards in 1531, without any
permanent results.</p>

naval stores without the intervention of foreign merchants. As
early as 1583, Carlisle, who was son-in-law to Secretary Walsingham,
had subscribed a thousand pounds toward an American
colony, which it was urged would buy English woolens, take off
idle and burdensome people, and, among other things, produce
naval stores. In 1601 Ralegh had protested eloquently against
the act to compel Englishmen to sow hemp. "Rather let every
man use his ground to that which it is most fit for," he said.

the statement seems hardly credible. In the midst of the misery
following the massacre of 1622, and notwithstanding the imminent
probability of the overthrow of the company, which was
already impoverished, some of the adventurers or shareholders
sent nine men to Virginia to try a different method of making
iron from the one that had previously been used. Letter of
August 6, 1623, in Manuscript Book of Instructions in Library of
Congress, fol. 120. Having "failed to effect" the making of iron
"by those great wayes which we have formerly attempted," the
undiscouraged visionaries "most gladly embraced this more
facile project" of making iron "by bloom," but with a like result,

"our treasurer of England," arbitrarily raised the duty on tobacco
from twopence a pound to six shillings tenpence. He was probably
moved to make this surprising change by his antipathy to
tobacco; but by increasing the profits of the farmers of customs
and monopolists of tobacco, he no doubt contributed to that
abandonment of Virginia to tobacco raising which seemed to him
so lamentable. The use of Spanish tobacco in England was
general before that from Virginia began to take its place. Barnabee
Rich says, in 1614: "I have heard it tolde that now very

The author's view is evidently distorted by biographer's myopia.
He often seems to depend on tradition, but in some passages his
touch is more sure, and he writes like a man who has documents
before him. Arthur Woodnoth's Short Collection of the Most
Remarkable Passages from the Originall to the Dissolution of the
Virginia Company is of great value. It is a scarce tract, which I
met first in the White-Kennett Library, in the rooms of the Society
for the Propagation of the Gospel. It is also in the British
Museum, Harvard College, and the Library of Congress. It is
to be taken with discrimination, but the view of the inner workings
of court intrigue as it affected Virginia is so fresh and detailed
that it would be a pity to miss its information. It was
printed in 1651. There is a brief sketch of the life of Sandys in
Brown's Genesis of the United States, ii, 993.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Love of display in Elizabeth's time.</span> Not religious disputants only, but the world in
general, exaggerated the importance of vestments
and ceremonies in the reign of Elizabeth. The
love of formality and display that characterized
the Renascence was then at its height. It was a
time of pomps and royal progresses. Great historic
characters went about dressed like performers
in a show. Some of the queen's gowns were
adorned with jewels on every available inch of
space. These bespangled robes were draped over
vast farthingales, which spread out like tables on
which her arms might rest, and her appearance
when thus attired has been compared to that of
an Oriental idol. Her courtiers and statesmen
were equally fond of dazzling the spectator.
Ralegh wore a pendent jewel on his hat feather,
and the value of the gems on his shoes was estimated
at six thousand six hundred pieces of gold.
The love of pomp was not confined to the court;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name="page99"></a>(p. 99)</span> every nobleman and country gentleman kept his
house filled with idle serving men, the sons of
neighboring gentlemen or yeomen, whose use was
to "grace the halls" of their patron by their attendance
and to give dignity to his hospitality.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_1" name="note_b2_c1_1"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_1">Note 1.</a></span>
High sheriffs and other officials performed their
functions with thirty or forty men in livery at
their heels, even borrowing the retainers of their
friends to lend state to their office. <span class="sidenote">Machyn's Diary, 324, note.</span> Edward VI
set out upon a progress in 1551 with a train of
four thousand mounted men. These were noblemen
and gentlemen with their retainers. He was
obliged to dismiss all but a hundred and fifty of
this vast army of display lest it should "eat up
the country." The gorgeous progresses of Elizabeth
are too well known to need description. A
painting of the time shows her to us in the act of
making a friendly call on her cousin-german, Lord
Hunsdon. She is sitting under a canopy, and is
borne on the shoulders of men and attended by a
brilliant train of lords and ladies on foot. It was
truer in the days of Shakespeare than it has been
since that "all the world's a stage, and all the men
and women merely players."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The age of the drama.</span> A passionate love of the theater was inevitable
in such a time. The best poetry then took a dramatic
form; even history was taught from the
stage; and satire and polemics felt the attraction
and were often put into imaginary dialogues. It
was Shakespeare's good fortune that he happened
to live among a people fond of show and in an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> age dramatic as well as poetic to its very core.
Genius is nourished by sympathy, and supremely
great performance is rendered possible only by the
rare coincidence of the great man and a fitting
environment.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Display in dress.</span> Dress signified more to the men of the time of
Elizabeth and James than it is easy for us moderns
to imagine. Greatness declared itself by external
display. The son of a rich merchant when he returned
from his travels decked himself in gorgeous
apparel, and formally made his appearance
on the Exchange like a butterfly newly emerged.
<span class="sidenote">Peckard's Life of Ferrar.</span> It was thus that his parents brought the young
man out in the world. A sum equal in purchasing
power to several thousand dollars in our time
is said to have been spent on one pair of trunk
hose. <span class="sidenote">Stubbes, Anatomie of Abuses, <i>passim</i>.</span> Men of the lowest ranks, desirous of appearing
more than they were, impoverished themselves
in buying expensive hats and hose; and it is recorded
that women suffering for the necessaries of
life sometimes contrived to adorn themselves with
velvet. For the very reason that so much importance
was attached to dress, laws were made to
repress inappropriate display in people of lower
rank. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_2" name="note_b2_c1_2"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_2">Note 2.</a></span> Even the severe Puritan moralists did not
object to the pomp of the great, but to the extravagant
imitation of it by those who had no right to
such ostentation. It was with difficulty that men
could conceive of greatness without display. To
refuse a bishop his vestments was to abate something
of his lofty rank.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> II.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Observance of ceremonies.</span> Along with a love for external show went a
scrupulous observance of decorous and often pompous
ceremonies. Englishmen in the sixteenth and
the early part of the seventeenth century never
omitted to observe proper formality, no matter
how dire the emergency. One may see this exemplified
by reverting to some of the earliest events
in American history. <span class="sidenote">Compare <i>supra</i>, p. 41.</span> When Gates arrived at
Jamestown near the close of the "starving time,"
he found only the gaunt ghosts of men clamoring
to be taken from the scene of so many horrible
miseries. Instead of giving immediate attention
to the sufferings of the people, he caused the little
church bell to be rung. Such of the inhabitants
as could drag themselves out of their huts repaired
once more to the now ruined and unfrequented
church with its roof of sedge and earth supported
by timbers set in crotches. Here the newly arrived
chaplain offered a sorrowful prayer, and then
George Percy, the retiring governor, delivered
up his authority to Sir Thomas Gates, who thus
found himself in due and proper form installed
governor of death, famine, and desperation. When
Gates abandoned the wrecked town with his starving
company he fired a "peale of small shott," in
order not to be wanting in respect for a royal fort;
and when De la Warr arrived, a few days later, he
made his landing with still greater pomp than that
of Gates. There was a flourish of trumpets on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> shipboard before he struck sail in front of Jamestown.
A gentleman of his party bore the colors of
the governor before him. The governor's first act
when he set foot on American soil was to fall on
his knees and offer a long, silent prayer, which was
probably sincere though theatrical, after the manner
of the age. He rose at length and marched up
into the ruined town. As he passed into the stockade
by the water gate, which was shabbily off its
hinges, the color bearer dropped down before him
and allowed the colors to fall at the feet of his
lordship, who proceeded to the tumble-down
chapel, under the earthen roof of which the authority
over the colony was duly transferred to his
hands with such solemnities as were thought proper.
Whenever Lord De la Warr went to church at
Jamestown he was attended by the councilors, captains,
and gentlemen, and guarded by fifty men
with halberds, wearing De la Warr's livery of
showy red cloaks. <span class="sidenote">Strachey, in Purchas, iv, 17-54.</span> The governor's seat was a
chair covered with green velvet. <span class="sidenote">De la Warr's letter, in Strachey's Virginia, p. xxix.</span> It was in the
choir of the now reconstructed little church, and a
velvet cushion lay on the table before him to enable
him to worship his Maker in a manner becoming
the dignity of a great lord over a howling wilderness.
More than a quarter of the able-bodied
men in Virginia were needed to get the governor
to church and back again aboard the ship where
he dwelt.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Formality at Plymouth.</span> Even at a later date in the rather hungry little
Pilgrim colony at Plymouth almost as much ceremony
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span> was observed, though the people were extreme
Puritans without rank. At beat of drum on
Sunday morning the men came to Captain Standish's
door with their cloaks on, each bearing a musket
or matchlock. They proceeded to church three
abreast, led by a sergeant. In the rear walked the
governor, in a long robe. On his right was Elder
Brewster, wearing a cloak. <span class="sidenote">De Rasieres's letter, 2d N. Y. Hist. Coll., ii, 352.</span> On the governor's left
was Captain Miles Standish, who also wore a cloak
and side arms, and carried a small cane as a sort
of baton of authority perhaps. Thus "they march
in good order, and each sets his arms down near
him."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Puritanism an outgrowth of the time.</span> It was only in an age such as this that resistance
to the celebration of rites and the observance of
forms could be made a capital article of faith by the
Puritan, and later by the Quaker. The wearing of
a surplice, the propriety of doffing the hat on certain
occasions, was a matter for scruple and violent
debate, for the grave consideration of the lawgiver
and magistrate, and for severe penalties.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Origin of the Puritan movement.</span> <span class="sidenote">Fuller's Ch. Hist., book v, sec. iv, 27, 28.</span> In the brief Protestant reign of Edward VI
there were those who objected to "the vestments,"
and one may even find what were afterward
called Puritan opinions condemned among
current errors in the twenty-eighth year of Henry
VIII; but Puritanism&mdash;as a party protest against
pomp and ceremonialism in religious worship&mdash;had
its origin in the persecution of Queen Mary's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> time. <span class="sidenote">1536.</span> The English Protestants who fled from that
fiery ordeal found refuge chiefly in Protestant cities
of the Continent. Strasburg, Frankfort, Basel,
Zurich, and Geneva were the places to which these
English exiles mainly resorted. Zurich and Strasburg
became cities of refuge for many of those
who were to become leaders of the Anglican or
Conservative party, while others who tended to
what were afterward called Puritan views went
sooner or later to Geneva, where Calvin was the
dominant influence.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A. D. 1553.</span> In the cities in which they found safety the
exiles organized English churches. <span class="sidenote">The English exiles.</span> More remarkable
religious communities were never gathered
into single congregations. Five bishops and five
deans of the English Church, and more than fifty
eminent doctors of divinity, with younger men who
were destined to play a leading part in the future,
were comprised in these little churches. Such
communities soon became centers of animated discussion
and debate.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Outbreak of dissension.</span> During the preceding reign of King Edward
VI, English Protestantism had been forced into
many compromises within itself. No form of religious
life can become national without exacting
of its advocates of differing shades of opinion many
sacrifices for the sake of unity; but now that the
leaders of English Protestantism were in exile they
found themselves in a measure freed from motives
of policy and with leisure to develop and apply
their theories. A passion for the ideal thus suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span> unchained easily becomes rampant. There sprang
up swiftly a dispute between the church in Strasburg
and the church in Frankfort on matters of
government. The reformatory spirit is rarely conciliatory,
and in its excess and overflow it is wont to
be pragmatic and impertinent. Some of the reformers
of Strasburg felt bound to go over to Frankfort
and re-reform the reformed English church there;
and the little English community in Frankfort was
soon torn asunder between the followers of Richard
Cox and those of John Knox&mdash;the same who
was afterward so famous in the Scottish reformation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Character of the debates at Frankfort.</span> This dispute in Frankfort between the Coxans
and the Knoxans, as they were called, had all the
characteristics that render church quarrels odious.
One finds in it the bitterness of slanderous violence&mdash;the
little deceptions and unmanly treacheries
that characterize such debates and disclose the
sorry threadbareness of human saintship even in
exiles and martyrs for conscience' sake. But, petty
as were these squabbles at Frankfort, they produced
results of the first magnitude. Small things
change the whole course of history when they lie
near the fountain head of a great current. From
the conflicting factions in the church of the exiles
at Frankfort were evolved the opposing parties
that were to give character to English Protestantism,
and to modify profoundly the history of England
and as profoundly the history of the United
States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span> <span class="sidenote">The rise of the two great parties.</span> In the contentions of the English at Frankfort,
resulting now in the exiling from the city of one
beaten minority and now in the departure of another,
and in the driving away of one leading disputant
after another, there appeared at length the
features of the two great parties of English Protestantism
face to face for the first time. One of these
parties tried to hold all of antique ritual that the
Protestant conscience could be made to bear, insisted
upon the superior authority of the clergy,
and sought to disturb as little as possible the ancient
order of the English church. On the other hand,
in the rapid changes produced by the Frankfort
contentions, the tendency of the ultra wing of the
Protestants to the notion of a local and independent
church and to a democratic church government
was already apparent. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_3" name="note_b2_c1_3"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_3">Note 3.</a></span> Even the peculiarity of
two ministers presiding over one church, which
was cherished later in New England, appeared
among the English at Frankfort and Geneva at this
time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A purified ritual.</span> While attempting to mediate between the parties
at Frankfort, Calvin expressed his preference
for a ritual of greater purity than that established
by the English Prayer Book of King Edward's time.
Extreme Protestants rallied round this ideal of a
liturgy purified of human tradition. It was some
years later, after the Frankfort church had been
dissolved and the exiles had returned to England,
that this party came to be known by the name
of Puritan&mdash;that is, a party not so much bent on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>(p. 107)</span> purity of conduct as on purifying Protestant worship
from mediæval forms. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_4" name="note_b2_c1_4"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_4">Note 4.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Return of the exilies, 1558.</span> After the death of Mary and the accession of
Elizabeth the English Protestants returned to their
own country. The two great parties that were to
divide the English church had already begun to
crystallize. Those who had settled at Strasburg
and Zurich came back hoping to re-establish the
Anglican Church on the conservative basis of the
Prayer Book of Edward VI. Those who returned
from Basel and Geneva had caught the spirit of
the Calvinistic churches, and wished to push the
reformation to a more logical extreme; while the
Frankfort church, or what remained of it, had been
storm-driven well-nigh to a theory of congregational
independence in church government.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Results.</span> The petty squabbles of the English exiles, transplanted
to England, grew into bitter feuds and
brought forth persecutions and political struggles.
The settlement of New England, the battles of
Marston Moor and Naseby, the temporary overthrow
of the English monarchy, the growth of non-conformity,
the modification of the English Constitution
and of all English life, were germinally
present in the differences between the exiles at
Zurich and those at Geneva, and in the squabbles
of Cox and Knox, of Whithead and Horne at
Frankfort-on-the-Main about gowns and litanies and
the authority of the priest. It is not often that a
great historical movement can be traced through a
single rill to its rise at the fountain head.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span> IV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Puritan debate.</span> The theological debates that fill so large a
place in the history of the first half of the sixteenth
century in Europe were mainly concerned
with speculative dogmas. However futile controversies
may seem that seek to reduce to formulas
the relations between God and man, they have at
least a topical dignity. But the debates about ceremonies
and vestments which the exiles brought
back to England from the Continent, and which
held first place there during the reign of Elizabeth
and James, were bitter without being serious. A
life-and-death struggle concerning the wearing of
"white surplices" or the making of the sign of
the cross in baptism can not but seem frivolous to
the modern mind. <span class="sidenote">Certayne Qvestions concerning silk or vvool in the high
priest's ephod, 1605.</span> Learned scholars like Broughton
and Ainsworth thought it not beneath them to
write tractates discussing the material of which
the ephod of a Jewish high priest was made. It
was learnedly demonstrated that the ephod was
of silk, and there were sober essays on the linsey-woolsey
side of that controversy. To the fine-spun
mind of that time the character of the Jewish
ephod was thought to settle the propriety of the
Christian surplice. To the modern reader the
whole debate about vestments and liturgies would
be amusing if it were not so tedious. It is necessary
to steady one's judgment of that age by
remembering that deeper things sometimes lay
concealed under these disputes regarding the contemptible
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>(p. 109)</span> mint and cumin of ecclesiasticism. Puritanism
at its rise was an effort to escape from
formalism, the outgrowth of an aspiration for
greater spirituality in worship; but it gradually
passed into an opposite formalism as rigid as that
from which it had escaped.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Uniformity not possible.</span> It was in vain that Elizabeth tried to compel
uniformity. The difference between the radical
and the conservative is constitutional, and is manifest
in every period of agitation. Neither the mediation
of moderate men nor the compulsion of
authority can bring these two sempiternal divisions
of the human race into agreement. The conservative
English churchman limited his Protestantism
to the rejection of the pope's authority, and to certain
moderate reforms in church government and
ritual. He shuddered with alarm at every proposal
to reconstruct religious institutions which
were moss-grown with ancient sentiment. The
extreme Puritan, on the other hand, went about
his work in the spirit of a Jehu. He saved all his
reverence for the precepts of the Bible, now becoming
common in the vulgar tongue. He applied
biblical phraseology to the affairs of life in a
way that would have been impossible had he possessed
any sense of humor. He felt himself impelled
by the call of God to carry out in England
the changes that had taken place in the Calvinistic
churches of the Continent, and to go even further.
He would have no surplices, no sign of the cross,
no liturgy, no church holy days. Away with these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>(p. 110)</span> rags of Antichrist, was his cry. Let us get back
to the simplicity of the primitive ages. The Anglican,
on the other hand, felt himself an Englishman
above all, and without a stately liturgy, great
bishops in square caps and lawn sleeves, Christmas
feasts, solemn Good Fridays, and joyous Easters,
there would have remained for him no merry
England.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Growth of party spirit.</span> The party line between Anglican and Puritan
was not at once sharply drawn. It was only after
debates growing ever more acrimonious, after persecutions
and numberless exasperations, that the
parties in the Church of England fell into well-defined
and hostile camps. If there had been some
relaxation of the requirements of uniformity, if a
conciliatory policy had been pursued by the government,
the ultimate division might have been
postponed until party spirit had cooled; but in
that day blows took the place of words, and words
had the force of blows. The queen herself could
write to a bishop who scrupled to do what she desired,
"By God, I will unfrock you!" and moderation
in debate was not to be expected from lesser
folk.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Puritanism the party of opposition.</span> When the reformer has warmed to his work he
looks about him for new abuses to fall upon. The
dominant discontent of any age is prone to spread
its wings over other grievances, and feebler movements
seek shelter from the strong. Puritanism
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>(p. 111)</span> no doubt gathered momentum from the widespread
agrarian and industrial disturbance in this
and the preceding reigns. The profit from sheep-raising
had induced many manor lords to inclose
the wastes on which the peasants had pastured
their cattle for ages. The humble copy-hold tenant,
having no longer grass for his cows or mast
for his pigs, was driven to distress by agricultural
progress. In some cases even the common fields,
cultivated in allotments from ancient times by the
members of the village communities, first as serfs
and later as tenants, were turned into sheepwalks,
and hamlets of tenants' cottages were torn down
to make room for more profitable occupants of the
soil. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_5" name="note_b2_c1_5"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_5">Note 5.</a></span> The worst offenders were the greedy courtiers
who had secured the estates of the English
monasteries. Workmen ruined by the dissolution
of the guilds were added to the ranks of the unhappy.
All the discontent begotten of these transitions
from mediæval life tended to strengthen the
leading opposition&mdash;and that leading opposition
was Puritanism.</p>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Widening the field of protest.</span> Puritanism also progressively widened its field
of protest. Beliefs that Protestants rejected were
symbolized by the vestments of bishop and clergy.
Advanced Protestants insisted that the shadows
should be banished with the substance, that the
symbol should disappear with the dogma. We
have seen that in Frankfort the inchoate Puritan
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>(p. 112)</span> party wished to abolish the litany and purge the
service book of all the remains of the old religion.
This controversy raged in England, and the Puritan
side did not at first lack support even among
the bishops. But Elizabeth, the real founder of
Anglicanism, molded the church to her will, putting
down Catholics and Puritans with a hard
hand. The more advanced of the party came at
length to believe that all "stinted" prayers "read
out of a book" were contrary to the purity and
simplicity of Christian worship. The hostility of
the bishops to that which the Puritans believed to
be the cause of God no doubt helped to convince
the persecuted party that the episcopal office itself
was contrary to Scripture.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Puritanism becomes dogmatic.</span> Most of the Puritans of Elizabeth's time, under
the lead of the great Cartwright, became Presbyterian
in theory and sought to assimilate the Church
of England to the Calvinistic churches of the Continent,
holding that theirs was the very order prescribed
by the apostles. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_6" name="note_b2_c1_6"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_6">Note 6.</a></span> Another but much smaller
division of the Puritans tended toward independency,
finding in the New Testament a system different
from that of Cartwright. Both the Presbyterians
and those who held to local church
government wished to see their own system established
by law. Neither faction thought of tolerating
Anglican practices if the Anglicans could be
put down. The notion of a state church with prescribed
forms of worship enforced by law was too
deeply imbedded in the English mind to be easily
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span> got rid of, and the spirit of persecution pervaded
every party, Catholic or Protestant. Every one
was sure that divine authority was on his side, and
that human authority ought to be.</p>

<h4>VII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Anglicanism becomes dogmatic.</span> A corresponding change began to take place
in the Episcopal party. The earlier defenders of
Elizabeth's establishment argued, somewhat as
Hooker did later, that the "practice of the apostles"
was not an "invariable rule or law to succeeding
ages, because they acted according to the
circumstances of the church in its infant and persecuted
state." Episcopal government they held to
be allowable, and maintained the attitude of prudent
men who justify their compromise with history
and the exigency of the time, and advocate, above
all, submission to civil authority. But the tendency
of party division is to push both sides to
more positive ground. There arose in the last
years of Elizabeth a school of High-churchmen
led by Bancroft, afterward primate, who turned
away from Hooker's moderation and assumed a
more aggressive attitude. Like the Presbyterians
and the Independents and the Catholics, these
in turn maintained that their favorite system of
church economy was warranted by divine authority,
and that all others were excluded.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Failure of Elizabeth's policy.</span> When the High-church leaders had reached
the dogmatic assertion of apostolic succession and
a divinely appointed episcopal form of government
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> as essentials of a Christian church, the fissure between
the two ecclesiastical parties in England
was complete. Each had settled itself upon a supposed
divine authority; each regarded the other
as teaching a theory contrary to the divine plan.
Elizabeth's policy of repression had produced a
certain organic uniformity, but the civil war of the
seventeenth century was its ultimate result.</p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bitterness of the debate.</span> The controversy between the two Protestant
parties naturally grew more bitter as time went on.
The silencing of ministers, the Fleet Prison, the
inquisitorial Ecclesiastical Commission, and other
such unanswerable arguments did not sweeten the
temper of the Puritans. The bitterness of the controversy
reached its greatest intensity in 1588, when
there appeared a succession of anonymous tracts,
most of them signed Martin Marprelate. They
seem to have been written mainly by the same
hand, but their authorship has been a matter of
debate to this day.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Marprelate tracts.</span> The sensation produced by these violent assaults
is hardly conceivable now. There were no newspapers
then, and there was but little popular literature. <span class="sidenote">1588.</span>
Here were little books printed no one
knew where, written by no one knew whom,
concerning a religious controversy of universal
interest. They were couched in the phrase of the
street, in the very slang and cant of the populace,
and were violent and abusive, sometimes descending
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span> to sheer blackguardism. Marprelate went
gunning for large game; his deadliest abuse he let
fly as from a blunderbuss at the very heads of the
English church. The Dean of Salisbury he calls
"Doctor of Diviltrie and Deane of Sarum." It
was the first time in the history of polemics that
any one had addressed a high dignitary of the
church with such irreverent titles as "You grosse
beaste!" "You block, you!" Sometimes Martin
bends his knees with mock reverence, as when he
calls the clergy "right poysond, persecuting and
terrible priests." He blurts out epithets against
"the sinful, the unlawful, the broken, the unnatural,
false, and bastardly governours of the church; to
wit, archbishops and bishops"; and addresses them
as "you enemies to the state, you traytors to God
and his worde, you Mar-prince, Mar-land, Mar-magestrate,
Mar-church, and Mar-commonwealth." <span class="sidenote">The Marprelate tracts in Lenox Library.</span>
The spice of the books, that which gave them their
popularity, was doubtless their rollicking impudence.
"Wo&mdash;ho, now, Brother London!" he cries
to the Bishop of London. "Go to, you Asse!" is a
kind of kennel eloquence relished by the populace.
Martin seems even to giggle and sneer and hiss in
type in such expressions as "tse, tse, tse."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">An Admonition to the People of England, p. 25.</span> The little books went everywhere. The Bishop
of Winchester sadly confessed that these "slanderous
pamphlets, freshe from the presse," were "in
men's hands and bosoms commonly." The queen
and courtiers read them, and students had nothing
better to laugh at. Who will not stop in the street
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span> to hear one clown rail cleverly at another? But to
see the bishops collectively and the primate and
others severally put into a pillory and pelted in this
daring fashion by a man who knew that his life
would pay the forfeit for his libel if he could by
any means be discovered, was livelier sport than
bull-baiting.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, Bishop of Winchester, replied to
the first pamphlet somewhat ponderously, as became
a bishop who feels that the proprieties forbid
his being too interesting. Marprelate wanted
nothing better than a bishop for an antagonist;
and while the whole constabulary force of the
kingdom was hunting him for his life, the nimble
Martin was chuckling over the excitement made
by a new tract of his, headed with the well-known
street cry of a tub-mender, which played derisively
on Bishop Cooper's name, "Hay any worke for
Cooper?" This tract professed to be "printed
in Europe not farre from some of the Bounsing
priestes." <span class="sidenote">Nugæ Antiquæ, ii, 89, 90.</span> In this paper Martin shows to what
depth a religious debate in Elizabeth's time could
descend; he stoops to make the bishop ridiculous
by twitting him with the infidelity of his wife, a
scandal which the unfortunate prelate had treated
with "Socratical and philosophical patience."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lenox Collection, N. Y. Pub. Library.</span> There were not wanting many imitators of Martin's
grossness on the other side of the controversy,
who were just as libelous but for the most part less
clever. One of the tracts in reply was called An
Almond for a Parrat. The author says he had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> heard that Martin was dead, or, as he expressed
it, "that your grout-headed holinesse had turned
uppe your heeles like a tired jade in a medow and
snorted out your sorrowefull soule, like a mesled
hogge on a mucke-hille." This is beastly without
being vivacious. <span class="sidenote">Comp. Bacon's An Advertisement touching Controversies,
etc.</span> While the press and the stage
were occupied with coarse retorts on Martinism,
there appeared tracts in favor of peace. There are
other evidences of the existence of a moderate
party that lamented the excesses of both sides in
this debate.</p>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Advance of Puritan opinions.</span> Puritanism was evolutionary from the beginning.
Its earlier disputes about vestments and
litanies grew by degrees to a rejection of all liturgies
as idolatrous. Even the reading of the Bible
as a part of the service came at last to be reprehended
by extremists, and the repetition of the
Lord's Prayer was thought dangerously liturgical.
The advanced Puritans sought to exclude from
Christian worship everything pleasing to the æsthetic
sense, confounding bareness with simplicity.
Compromises continued to be made inside the
church, but in the ultimate ideal of Puritan worship
there remained, besides the sermon, nothing
but long extemporary prayers and the singing by
the untrained voices of the congregation of literal
versions of the Hebrew Psalms&mdash;doggerel verse in
cobblestone meters.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> X.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Opposition to May-poles.</span> In its early stages Puritanism was a crusade
against idolatry, and drew its inspiration in this, as
in nearly everything else, from the Old Testament.
To the word "idolatry" it gave an inclusiveness
not found in the Jewish Scriptures, and puzzling to
a mind accustomed to modern ways of thinking.
There was hardly any set observance of the church
in which constructive idolatry did not lie concealed.
All holy days except Sunday were abhorred as
things that bore the mark of the Beast. Even in
the reign of Edward VI, long before the name
of Puritanism was known, the May-poles round
which English people made merry once a year
were denounced as idols in a sermon preached at
Paul's Cross by Sir Stephen&mdash;the "Sir" being a
polite prefix to a clergyman's name. This Stephen,
curate of St. Catherine Cree, was a forerunner of
Puritanism, who sometimes defiantly preached from
an elm tree in the chuchyard and read the service
standing on a tomb on the north side of the
church. He wanted the saintly names of churches
and the heathen names of days of the week
changed, so keen was his scent for idolatry. The
parish of St. Andrew Undershaft had received its
distinctive name from a very tall May-pole that
overtopped the church steeple. This pole was
erected annually, and it rested from one May to
another on hooks under the eaves of a row of
houses and stalls. In the newborn Protestant zeal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span> against idols Sir Stephen denounced especially the
lofty shaft of St. Andrew. <span class="sidenote">1549.</span> The people in their
rage took it from the hooks and sawed it in pieces,
and its sections were appropriated by the several
householders who had given it shelter and who
presently heaped its parts upon one great bonfire.
Puritanism kept up its Don Quixote battle against
May-poles until there was hardly one standing to
seduce the people to idolatry. <span class="sidenote">Rushworth, Pt. III, vol. ii, 749. A. D. 1644.</span> When the Puritan
party came into power, nearly a hundred years
after the days of Sir Stephen of St. Catherine Cree,
one of its earliest laws ordered that all May-poles&mdash;"an
heathenish vanity generally abused to superstition
and wickedness"&mdash;be taken down.</p>

<h4>XI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Austerity in morals.</span> From denouncing constructive idolatry in organ
music, litanies, and May-poles, the transition
to attack on the more real and substantial evils in
ordinary conduct was inevitable. History has
many examples of this pervasiveness of scrupulosity.
The Puritan conscience had been let loose
to tear in pieces the remnants of old superstitions.
It was certain to break over into the field of conduct.
Having set out to reform the church, it took
the world by the way.</p>

<p>As early as 1583 Philip Stubbes, a Puritan
lawyer, issued his hot little book, The Anatomie of
Abuses. It deals with the immoralities and extravagances
of the time. Stubbes repeats the early
Puritan objection to the May-pole: it is a "stinckyng
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> idol," he declares, which the people bring from
the woods, "followyng it with greate devotion."
And when they have set it up they "leape and
daunce aboute it, as the heathen people did at the
dedication of their idolles." But Stubbes takes a
step forward and objects to the all-night May frolics
on account of their immorality. He says, "I
have heard it credibly reported by men of great
gravitie, credite and reputation, that of fourtie, three
score, or a hundred maides goyng to the woods
over night, there have scarcely the third parte of
them returned home againe undefiled." <span class="sidenote">Pickering's ed., p. 172.</span> As men
of "great gravitie, credite and reputation" were not
likely to know the facts in this case, some of the
immorality with which Stubbes charges the young
people may have been as fanciful as the heathenism
attributed to them. Imputed unrighteousness was
a part of the Puritan system. He denounces the
wild excesses in dress and the other follies of the
time with a lack of a sense of proportion which already
foreshadows later Puritanism.</p>

<p>This secondary development of Puritanism by
which its energies were turned toward the regulation
of conduct, as the disputes of the Reformation
period lost their violence, gave to the name Puritan
a new and higher sense. It is a phase of its history
more important than all its primary contentions
over gowns and liturgies and hierarchies, or its
later debates about the five points of Calvinism and
a sabbatical Sunday. One may easily forget its
austerity and extravagance, for by the reform of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span> manners this movement made the English race its
debtor. In no succeeding reaction have English
morals reverted to the ante-Puritan level. It is
only by the religious ferments infused successively
by new sects and movements, of preaching friars,
Lollards, Puritans, Quakers, Methodists, Salvationists,
that the great unleavened mass of men is rendered
gradually less sodden.</p>

<h4>XII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Puritan decline.</span> The last years of Elizabeth's long reign were
years of apparent Puritan decline. The old bugbear
of popery was receding into the past, and a
new generation had come on the stage that had
no memory of the struggles of the reigns of
Henry and Edward and Mary. The danger from
the Armada had brought English patriotism to
the point of fusion. Even the persecuted Catholics
rallied to the support of the queen against
Philip. The government of Elizabeth rose to the
zenith of its popularity on the overthrow of the
Armada. It was just at this inopportune moment,
when the nation had come to feel that the England
of Elizabeth was the greatest England the
ages had known, that there came forth from a small
coterie of the oppressed ultra-Puritans the Martin
Marprelate tracts. <span class="sidenote"><i>Supra</i>, page 115.</span> However effective these may
have been at first in making the bishops ridiculous,
there followed a swift reaction. The Puritans
were dubbed Martinists, and henceforth had
to bear the odium of the boisterous vulgarity and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> libelous exaggeration of the Marprelate lampoons.
The queen's government, stronger now than ever
in the affection of the people, put in force severe
ecclesiastical measures against nonconformists in
the church, and sent Brownists, or Separatists,
to die by the score in loathsome prisons. Half
a dozen of their leaders were dispatched by the
shorter road of the gallows. The long reign of
the queen had by this time discouraged those who
hoped for a change of policy at her death. Hooker's
masterful and delightful prose, informed by
a spirit of winning moderation, was arrayed on the
side of the Anglicans by the publication of parts
of his Ecclesiastical Polity in 1594 and 1597. But
Puritanism suffered most from the persistence of
Archbishop Whitgift and others in efforts to suppress
all nonconformity in the church. <span class="sidenote">Rogers's Pref. to the 39 Articles.</span> These
champions of Anglicanism, in the swaggering
words of one of them, "defended the prelacy,
stood for the power of the state, put the new doctors
to the foil, profligated the elders, set upon the
presbytery, and so battered the new discipline as
hitherto they could never nor hereafter shall ever
fortify and repair the decay thereof." The presbyteries
which Cartwright and his friends had
formed within the Church of England were swept
out utterly by the archbishop's broom. The Puritan
movement which had begun almost simultaneously
with Elizabeth's reign seemed to be doomed
to languish and die with the old queen who had
been its resolute and lifelong antagonist.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> XIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Seeking a positive ground.</span> For the first thirty years or more of its existence
Puritanism was mainly a bundle of negations,
and no bundle of mere negations is a sufficient reason
for maintaining a party. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_7" name="note_b2_c1_7"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_7">Note 7.</a></span> No vestments, no
ceremonies, no bishops, were effective cries in the
hot Reformation period. But the new generation
had ceased to abhor these left-overs of Romanism.
Bishops, gowns, prayer books, had become Protestant
to most of the people by association. To find
additional reasons for differing from Anglican opponents
was a party necessity. The new debates
which sprang up in the last years of the sixteenth
century were not deliberately planned by the Puritans,
as some of their opponents asserted. They
came by a process of evolution. But a period of
temporary decline in a movement of this sort
hastens its natural unfolding. The leaders are
forced to seek the advantage of such new issues as
offer when the old ones fail. In the last years of
Elizabeth, Puritanism was molting, not dying.</p>

<h4>XIV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Puritan Sabbath.</span> The great reformers of the sixteenth century
had sought to strip from the Christianity of their
time what they deemed the second-hand garments
of Judaism. Along with the theory of a priesthood
they declared also against a doctrine known
in the church at least from the fifth century, that
the fourth commandment enforced on Christians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span> the keeping sacred in some sense of Sundays and
other church holy days. Luther maintained that
a commandment to keep the Sabbath "literally
understood does not apply to Christians, for it is
entirely outward, like other ordinances of the Old
Testament." He thought a festival day important
for rest and for attending religious worship; but
with characteristic oppugnancy he says: "If anywhere
the day is made holy for the mere day's
sake, ... then I order you to dance on it, and
feast on it, to do anything that shall remove this
encroachment on Christian liberty." The Augsburg
Confession makes a similar statement of the
Protestant position. Calvin considered the fourth
commandment binding on Christians only in a
sense mystical and highly Calvinistic. It signified
that "we should rest from our own works" under
the Christian dispensation. He even suggested
that some other day of the week might be chosen
as a day of rest and worship at Geneva for an exhibition
of Christian liberty in this regard. His
practice was conformed to his theory. It is incidentally
related that when John Knox once visited
the Genevan reformer on Sunday, he found him
playing at bowls. Knox was not more a sabbatarian
than Calvin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rise of the strict Sabbath.</span> Writers on this subject have generally agreed
in dating the rise of the Puritan Sabbath from the
appearance, in 1595, of Dr. Bownd's book on The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> Sabbath of the Old and of the New Testament.
But the doctrine of the strict keeping of Sunday
may be traced farther back. In truth, the difference
between the English and the Continental Sunday
dates from the Reformation. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_8" name="note_b2_c1_8"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_8">Note 8.</a></span> The protests of
Luther and Calvin go to show that Sunday had in
the church before the Reformation, theoretically
if not in practice, the sanctity of a church feast. <span class="sidenote">Compare Marsden's Early Puritans (1850) page 242, where
Becon's Catechism and Coverdale are quoted.</span>
The English Reformation was conservative, like all
other English revolutions. English reformers retained
the Catholic Sunday, as they did the vestments
and national hierarchy of the old church.
Thomas Hancock has been styled "the Luther of
the southwest of England." He was the great
preacher of Poole in the days of Edward VI.
That he, like other English reformers, did not
agree with Luther in rejecting the obligation to
rest on Sunday is shown by the record, for the
voice of Poole was the voice of Hancock. <span class="sidenote">Robert's Social Hist. of the Southern Counties, p.
239.</span> About
1550 the juries in the Admiralty Court of Poole
were charged to inquire into Sunday fishing; and
so advanced was the premature Puritanism of Edward's
time that even the leaving of nets in the sea
over Sunday was to be investigated. Here was a
strictness unknown in Catholic times. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_9" name="note_b2_c1_9"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_9">Note 9.</a></span></p>

<h4>XVI.</h4>

<p>The word Sabbath does not occur in these
early entries. But in the troubles among the
Marian exiles at Frankfort, where so many other
traits of Puritanism first came above the horizon, it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span> is significant that one finds Sunday called the Sabbath.
Sabbath as applied to Sunday occurs first
in literature, perhaps, in 1573, and then it is considered
necessary to explain it. Bullein's Dialogue
against the Fever Pestilence, a work of considerable
popularity, first appeared as early as 1564. In
the edition of 1573 there was inserted a new passage
not found in the earlier issue. <span class="sidenote"><i>Supra</i>, page 16.</span> Mendax is relating
incredible tales of travel in lands unknown,
after the manner of David Ingram and other returned
adventurers. Up to this point all is pure
lying merely for the fun of the thing, or perhaps to
ridicule the exaggerations of travelers. But the
interpolated passage is not of a piece with the old
garment into which it is patched. It is less grotesque
and humorous, and it smacks of incipient
Puritanism in several flavors. It treats first of all
of the "Kepyng of the Saboth Daie," "whiche is
the seventh daie, that is sondaie," in the imaginary
city of "Nodnol," an anagram of London. The
gates are shut, and nobody is allowed to "goe,
neither ride forth of the Citie duryng that daie,
except it be after the euenyng praier; then to
walke honestlie into the sweete fieldes, and at
every gate in the time of service there are warders."
"What so ever hee be he muste kepe hollie
the Sabboth daie, and come to the churche both
man, woman, young and olde." <span class="sidenote">Early English Text Society Reprint, 106, 107, 108.</span> "There were no
people walking abroad in the service tyme; no,
not a Dogge or catte in the streate, neither any
Taverne doore open that daie, nor wine bibbyng
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> in them, but onely almose, fasting and praier."
This is perhaps the oldest extant statement of an
early Puritan ideal of Sabbath-keeping.</p>

<h4>XVII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cox's Literature of the Sabbath Question, <i>sub anno</i>.</span> Scruples regarding recreations on Sunday
come distinctly into view in the title of a sermon
preached at Paul's Cross in 1576. In 1580 the
magistrates of London secured from the queen a
prohibition of the performance of plays within the
limits of the city on Sundays. <span class="sidenote">Robert's Southern Counties, pp. 238, 239.</span> In other municipalities&mdash;Brighton,
Yarmouth, and Lyme&mdash;ordinances
were made about this time against such offenses as
the prosecution on Sunday of the herring fisheries,
cloth working, and other labors, and even against
the Sunday practice of archery, formerly thought
a patriotic exercise. There are other evidences of
a movement, especially in the south of England, in
favor of a stricter Sabbath in these and the following
years. <span class="sidenote">1583.</span> Stubbes does not fail to denounce
"heathnicall exercises upon the Sabbaoth day,
which the Lorde would have consecrated to holy
uses." The Puritan mode of Sabbath-keeping already
existed among the chosen few. "The Sabboth
daie of some is well observed," says Stubbes,
"namely, in hearing the blessed worde of God
read, preached, and interpreted; in private and
publique praiers; in reading of godly psalmes; in
celebrating the sacraments; and in collecting for
the poore and indigent, which are the true uses
and endes whereto the Sabbaoth was ordained."
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> He records the opposite belief of his opponents
that Sunday was ordained "onely to use what
kinde of exercises they thinke good themselves."
In practice this was the rule of the English people
at large. <span class="sidenote">1588.</span> These opposite opinions come into
view when Martin Marprelate a few years later
berates the Bishop of London for playing at bowls
on Sunday.</p>

<h4>XVIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bownd on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="sidenote">1595.</span> Dr. Bownd's book on The Sabbath of the Old
and the New Testament, which, if we may believe
its opponents, was nearly ten years "in
the hammering," was the outcome of a sentiment
already rising among the Puritans, and
not wholly confined to that party. <span class="sidenote">1592.</span> It was preceded
by a little work of Richard Greenham
which seems to have been circulated for some
years in manuscript after a fashion of that time,
and to have had at first more influence on practice
than Bownd's formal treatise. Greenham was
Bownd's stepfather, and his work was the parent
of Bownd's, which is distinctly more extreme. But
Dr. Bownd's book is none the less memorable as a
point of departure, because in it the opinions on
this subject which have since prevailed so generally
in all English-speaking lands "were for the
first time broadly and prominently asserted in
Christendom"; at least, they were here first systematically
propounded and defended. Bownd
held that the fourth commandment is partly moral,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span> in the phrase of the casuists. He shifted the obligation
to the first day of the week by arguments
now familiar, and he laid down rules for the observance
of the day. Honest recreations and lawful
delights he flatly forbids on Sundays, but he
rather obsequiously makes some allowance for the
"feasts of noblemen and great personages on this
day." People of rank do not wholly escape him,
however, for he points a moral with the story of a
nobleman whose child was born with a face like
that of a dog, because the father had hunted on
the Lord's Day. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_10" name="note_b2_c1_10"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_10">Note 10.</a></span> He allows the ringing of only
one bell to call the people to church on Sunday.
Chimes were quite too pleasing to accord with a
severe Sabbath.</p>

<h4>XIX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Spread of Bownd's opinions.</span> Such rigor fell in with the passion of that
age for formal observance and with the exigent
temper of the Puritans by whom Bownd's
views were rapidly and universally accepted. <span class="sidenote">Cartwright's Admonition to Parliament, 1572.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Robert's Southern Counties, pp. 37, 38.</span>
The stricter divines might well be glad of a
new lever for reforming the old English Sunday,
which was devoted, out of service time, to
outdoor games, to the brutally cruel sports of
bull and bear baiting, to merry morris-dances,
in which the performers were gayly decked and
hung with jingling bells in different keys, as
well as to coarse farces called interludes, which
were played on stages under booths and sometimes
in the churches. As an austere reaction
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span> against frivolity, Puritanism pushed Sabbath-keeping
to its extreme, reprobating even the most
innocent and domestic recreations, and changing
a day of rest and refreshment into one of alternate
periods of application to religious devotion
and of scrupulous vacuity. Bownd's rather ultra
propositions were carried yet further when reproduced
by high-strung preachers. It is said
that some of these declared that the ringing of
more than one bell to call people to church on
the Sabbath was as great a sin as murder, adultery,
or parricide. The lack of a sense of proportion
is the specific distinction of the zealot and
the polemic. This lack was not peculiar to the
Puritans, however. Joseph Hall, afterward a well-known
bishop, could address men so worthy as
John Robinson and his colleague in such words
as these: "Your souls shall find too late ...
that even whoredoms and murders shall abide an
easier answer than separation." Perhaps one may
rather say that a lack of the sense of proportion
in morals was a trait of that age, an age of zealots
and polemics.</p>

<h4>XX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prevalence of the strict Sabbath.</span> In such a time Dr. Bownd's book easily captivated
the religious public, and there arose a
passion for a stricter Sabbath. According to
Fuller, the Lord's Day, especially in towns, "began
to be precisely kept, people becoming a
law to themselves, forbearing such sports as yet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span> by statute permitted; yea, many rejoicing at
their own restraint herein. On this day the
stoutest fencer laid down the buckler; the most
skillful archer unbent the bow, counting all
shooting beside the mark; May-games and morris-dancers
grew out of request; and good reason
that bells should be silenced from jingling about
men's legs, if their very ringing in steeples were
adjudged unlawful." <span class="sidenote">Fuller's Ch. Hist. of Britain, book ix, sect. viii, 20,
21.</span> Some learned scholars were
impressed by Bownd's argument, and others who
did not agree with his conclusions thought it best
not to gainsay them, "because they tended to the
manifest advance of religion." And indeed the
new zeal for Sabbath-keeping must have incidentally
promoted morals and good order in so licentious
an age.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Opposition to Bownd.</span> But a violent opposition quickly arose. Some
opposed the book as "galling men's necks with
a Jewish yoke against the liberty of Christians,"
and many of the clergy of the new high-church
type resented the doctrine of a Christian Sabbath,
asserting that it put "an unequal lustre
on the Sunday on set purpose to eclipse all
other holy days to the derogation of the authority
of the church." <span class="sidenote">Fuller's Church History, book ix, sect. viii, 21.</span> There were those who asserted
that the "brethren," as they styled them,
had brought forth Bownd's book, intending by
this "attack from an odd corner" to retrieve
lost ground. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_11" name="note_b2_c1_11"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_11">Note 11.</a></span> The manifest advantage to Puritanism
from the shifting of the ground of debate,
aroused Archbishop Whitgift. In 1599 he made
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span> the tactical mistake of ordering the book called
in, and in 1600 Chief-Justice Popham forbade
the reprinting of it. The price of the work
was doubled at once, and it was everywhere
sought for, books being "more called on when
called in," as Fuller says. When it could not
be had in print, it was transcribed by enthusiastic
admirers and circulated "from friend to
friend" in manuscript. As soon as Whitgift's
"head was laid," a new and enlarged edition
was published.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_12" name="note_b2_c1_12"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_12">Note 12.</a></span> The theory of a Sunday-Sabbath, which from
the first was not confined to the Puritans, permeated
English and American thought and life.
But from that time forward the Puritans made
rigid Sabbath-keeping the very mark and password
of the faithful. From England the theory
spread northward to Scotland, where it found a
congenial soil. <span class="sidenote">1611.</span> The strict observance of Sunday
was embodied in those Laws, Divine, Moral, and
Martial, under which Sir Thomas Dale oppressed
Virginia, years before the earliest Puritan migration
carried it to the coast of New England.
On that coast Bownd's Sabbath took on its
deepest hue, becoming at last as grievous an
evil, perhaps, as the frivolity it had supplanted.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c1_13" name="note_b2_c1_13"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c1_13">Note 13.</a></span></p>

<h4>XXI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Effect on Puritanism.</span> The Puritans protesting against Hebraism in
vestments, in priesthood, in liturgy, and in festivals,
fell headlong into the Pharisaism of the rigid Sabbath.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>(p. 133)</span> History records many similar phenomena.
To escape from the spirit of one's age is difficult
for an individual, impossible perhaps for a sect
or party. Nevertheless, the Sabbath agitation
had given a new impulse to the Puritan movement&mdash;had,
indeed, given it a positive party cry,
and had furnished it with a visible badge of
superior sanctity.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The new Puritanism.</span> The Calvinistic controversy which broke out
almost simultaneously with that about the Sabbath
and prevailed throughout the reign of
James I, added yet one more issue, by making
Puritanism the party of a stern and conservative
orthodoxy, as opposed to the newer Arminianism
which spread so quickly among the High-Church
clergy. From all these fresh developments
Puritanism gained in power and compactness, if
it lost something of simplicity and spirituality.
Standing for ultra-Protestantism, for good morals,
for an ascetic Sabbath, for a high dogmatic orthodoxy,
Puritanism could not but win the allegiance
of the mass of the English people, and especially
of the middle class. It was this new, compact,
austere, dogmatic, self-confident Puritanism, when
it had become a political as well as a religious
movement, that obliterated Laud and Charles and
set up the Commonwealth. And in studying the
evolution of this later Puritanism we have been
present at the shaping of New England in Old
England.</p>

Sheriff for Surrey and Sussex before they were disjoyned.
He had 116 servants in liverys, every one livery'd in greene sattin
doublets. Divers gentlemen and persons of quality waited on
him in the same garbe and habit, which at that time (when 30 or
40 was the usual retinue of a High Sheriff) was esteem'd a great
matter.... He could not refuse the civility of his friends and
relations who voluntarily came themselves, or sent in their servants."
Compare Chamberlain's remarks about Sir George Yeardley,
whom he styles "a mean fellow," and says that the king
had knighted him when he was appointed Governor of Virginia,
"which hath set him up so high that he flaunts it up and down
the streets in extraordinary bravery with fourteen or fifteen fair
liveries after him." Domestic Correspondence, James I, No. 110,
Calendar, p. 598. The propriety of keeping so many idle serving
men is sharply called in question in a tract entitled Cyuile and
Vncyuile Life, 1579, and an effort is made to prove the dignity of
a serving man's position, while its decline is confessed in A
Health to the Gentlemanly Profession of Servingmen, 1598. Both
of these tracts are reprinted in Inedited Tracts, etc., Roxburghe
Library, 1868. The serving man was not a menial. He rendered
personal services to his master or to guests, he could
carve on occasion, and as a successor to the military retainers
of an earlier time he was ready to fight in any of his master's
quarrels; but his principal use was to lend dignity to the mansion
and to amuse the master or his guests with conversation
during lonely hours in the country house. Among the first
Jamestown emigrants were some of these retainers, as we have
seen.</p>

is the primary authority. It is almost beyond doubt that Whittingham,
Dean of Durham, a participant in the troubles, wrote
the book. The Frankfort struggles have been discussed recently
in Mr. Hinds's The Making of the England of Elizabeth, but, like
all writers on the subject, Hinds is obliged to depend almost
solely on Whittingham's account. The several volumes of letters
from the archives of Zurich, published by the Parker Society,
give a good insight into the forces at work in the English Reformation.
See, for example, in the volume entitled Original Letters,
1537-1558, that of Thomas Sampson to Calvin, dated Strasburgh,
February 23, 1555, which shows the Puritan movement half
fledged at this early date when Calvin's authoritative advice is invoked.
"The flame is lighted up with increased vehemence
amongst us English. For a strong controversy has arisen, while
some desire the book of reformation of the Church of England to
be set aside altogether, others only deem some things in it objectionable,
such as kneeling at the Lord's Supper, the linen surplice,
and other matters of this kind; but the rest of it, namely,
the prayers, scripture lessons and the form of the administration
of baptism and the Lord's Supper they wish to be retained."</p>

tenantry is not a matter of conjecture. Philip Stubbes, in 1583,
in the Anatomie of Abuses, pp. 126, 127, writes: "They take in
and inclose commons, moores, heathes, and other common pastures,
where out the poore commonaltie, were wont to haue all
their forrage and feedyng for their cattell, and (whiche is more)
corne for themselves to liue vpon; all which are now in most
places taken from them, by these greedie puttockes to the great
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span> impouerishyng and vtter beggeryng of many whole townes and
parishes.... For these inclosures bee the causes why riche men
eate vpp poore men, as beastes dooe eate grasse." One might
cite recent economic writers on the effect of inclosures, but the
conservative laments of the antiquary Aubrey, in his Introduction
to the Survey of Wiltshire, written about 1663, give us a nearer
and more picturesque, if less philosophical, view. He says:
"Destroying of Manours began Temp. Hen. VIII., but now common;
whereby the mean People live lawless, no body to govern
them, they care for no body, having no Dependance on any Body.
By this Method, and by the Selling of the Church-Lands, is the
Ballance of the Government quite alter'd and put into the Hands
of the common People." Writing from what he had heard from
his grandfather, he says: "Anciently the Leghs i. e. Pastures
were noble large Grounds.... So likewise in his Remembrance
was all between Kington St. Michael and Dracot-Ferne common
Fields. Then were a world of labouring People maintained by
the Plough.... There were no Rates for the Poor in my Grandfather's
Days ... the Church-ale at Whitsuntide did the Business.... Since
the Reformation and Inclosures aforesaid these
Parts have swarm'd with poor People. The Parish of Caln pays
to the Poor 500£ <i>per annum</i>.... Inclosures are for the private,
not for the publick Good. For a Shepherd and his Dog, or a
Milk-Maid, can manage Meadow-Land, that upon arable, employ'd
the Hands of several Scores of Labourers." Miscellanies
on Several Curious Subjects, now first published, etc., 1723, pp.
30-33. It will fall within the province of another volume of this
series to treat of the systems of landholding brought from England,
and I shall not go further into the subject of inclosures here.
A portion of the agricultural population seemed superfluous in
consequence of inclosures, and colonization was promoted as a
means of ridding the country of the excess of its population.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b2_c1_6" name="anote_b2_c1_6"></a><a href="#note_b2_c1_6">Note 6, page 112.</a></span> In the matter of Church government Puritanism passed through
three different periods. In the reign of Elizabeth the Church-Puritan
was mainly Presbyterian under Cartwright's lead.
But there was even then a current that set toward Independency.
Separatism was the outward manifestation of this tendency, and
according to Ralegh's estimate, cited in the text, there were about
twenty thousand declared Separatists in England in 1593. After
the suppression of the presbyteries within the Church in the last
years of Elizabeth, and the crushing out of the Separatists by rigorous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>(p. 137)</span> persecutions, questions of the particular form of Church
government fell into abeyance among the Puritans for about forty
years. "Indiscriminate anti-prelacy was the prevailing mood of
the English people," says Masson, "and the distinction between
Presbyterianism and Independency was yet caviare to the general."
Life of Milton, ii, 590. Richard Baxter, the Puritan divine
(as quoted by Masson), confesses in 1641 that until that year he
had never thought what Presbytery or Independency was, or ever
spoke with a man who seemed to know it. See also Hanbury's
Memorials, ii, 69. Writers on this period do not seem to recognize
the fact that the two views were in some rivalry among the
early Puritans, and that the theory of the independence of the local
church seems to have been at least foreshadowed in the opinions
at Frankfort. But there was a long generation in which these
differences among the Puritans were forgotten in their life-and-death
conflict with the Episcopal party. Then, as Puritanism
came into power, the example of other Protestant European countries
drew England toward Presbyterianism, while the voice of New
England came from over the sea pleading for Congregationalism.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b2_c1_7" name="anote_b2_c1_7"></a><a href="#note_b2_c1_7">Note 7, page 123.</a></span> A letter of Sandys, afterward Archbishop of York, to Bullinger,
quoted by Marsden, Early Puritans, 57, shows that though Puritanism
by 1573 had become something other than it was at
Frankfort, it was still mainly negative. Sandys writes: "New orators
are rising up from among us; foolish young men who despise
authority and admit of no superior. They are seeking the complete
overthrow and uprooting of the whole of our ecclesiastical
polity; and striving to shape out for us I know not what new
platform of a church." He gives a summary under nine heads.
The assertion that each parish should have its own "presbytery"
and choose its own minister, and that the judicial laws of
Moses were binding, are the only positive ones. No authority
of the magistrate in ecclesiastical matters, no government of the
Church except by ministers, elders, and deacons, the taking away
of all titles, dignities, lands, and revenues of bishops, etc., from
the Church, the allowing of no ministers but actual pastors, the
refusal of baptism to the children of papists, fill the rest of this
summary. One misses from this skeleton the insistence on Sabbath-keeping,
church-going, "ordinances," and ascetic austerity
in morals that afterward became distinctive traits of the party.</p>

Sunday-Sabbath in the fifth century, basing it largely on grounds
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span> that now seem mystical. Compare Coxe on Sabbath Laws and
Sabbath Duties, 284, note, and Cook's Historical and General
View of Christianity, ii, 301, cited by Coxe. The question was
variously treated during the middle ages, St. Thomas Aquinas
and other schoolmen taking the prevalent modern view that the
fourth commandment was partly moral and partly ceremonial.
There is a curious story, for which I do not know the original authority,
of Eustachius, Abbot of Hay, in the thirteenth century,
who on his return from the Holy Land preached from city to
city against buying and selling on Sundays and saints' days. He
had with him a copy of a document dropped from heaven and
found on the altar of St. Simon, on Mount Golgotha. This
paper threatened that if the command were disobeyed it should
rain stones and wood and hot water in the night, and, as if
such showers were not enough, wild beasts were to devour the
Sabbath-breakers. That there was a difference of opinion in that
age is shown by the fact that Roger Bacon, later in the thirteenth
century, thought it worth while to assert that Christians should
work and hold fairs on Sunday, while Saturday was the proper
day for rest. He showed no document from heaven, but, like a
true philosopher of that time, the learned friar appealed to arguments
drawn from astrology. Hearne's Remains, ii, 177, cites
Mirandula. Legislation by Parliament regarding Sunday observance
was rare before the Reformation. A statute of 28 Edward
III incidentally excepts Sunday from the days on which
wool may be shorn, and one of 27 Henry VI forbids the keeping
of fairs and markets on Sundays, Good Fridays, and principal festivals
except four Sundays in harvest. In 4 Edward IV a statute
was passed forbidding the sale of shoes on Sundays and certain
festivals.</p>

Sparrow's Collection, edition of 1671, p. 8, there is a remarkable
statement of what may be called the Edwardean view of Sunday
as distinguished from the opinions and practice that had come
down from times preceding the Reformation: "God is more offended
than pleased, more dishonoured than honoured upon the
holy-day because of idleness, pride, drunkenness," etc. The religious
and moral duties to which the "holy-day," as it is called,
should be strictly devoted are there specified. But, true to the
position of compromise, halfwayness, and one might add paradox,
which the English Reformation took from the beginning,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span> there is added in the same paragraph the following: "Yet notwithstanding
all Parsons, Vicars, and Curates, shall teach and
declare unto their Parishioners, that they may with a safe and
quiet conscience, in the time of Harvest, labour upon the holy
and festival days and save that thing which God hath sent. And
if for any scrupulosity, or grudge of conscience, men should superstitiously
abstain from working upon those days, that then they
should grievously offend and displease God." See also "Thacte
made for thabrogacion of certayne holy-dayes," in the reign of
Henry VIII, 1536, in the same black-letter collection, p. 167. In
this act "Sabboth-day" occurs, but apparently with reference to
the Jewish Sabbath only. "Sonday" is used for Sunday.</p>

Greenham and Bownd, who sees a deep-laid plot in the publication
of their books. "What the brethren wanted in strength
they had in wiliness," he says. "For while these worthies of
our church were employing their engines and forces partly in defending
the present government ecclesiastical, partly in assaulting
the presbytery and new discipline, even at that very instant the
brethren ... abandoned quite the bulwarks which they had
raised and gave out were impregnable: suffering us to beat them
down, without any or very small resistance, and yet not careless
of affairs, left not the wars for all that, but from an odd corner,
and after a new fashion which we little thought of (such was
their cunning), set upon us afresh again by dispersing in printed
books (which for ten years' space before they had been in hammering
among themselves to make them complete) their Sabbath
speculations and presbyterian (that is more than kingly or
popely) directions for the observance of the Lord's Day." Preface
to Thirty-nine Articles, paragraph 20. He also says, with
some wit, "They set up a new idol, their Saint Sabbath."</p>

impression in Scotland until the seventeenth century was well
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> advanced. In the printed Burgh Records of Aberdeen from
1570 to 1625 there is no sabbatarian legislation in the proper
sense; but there are efforts to compel the people to suspend
buying and selling fish and flesh in the market, the playing of
outdoor games and ninepins, and the selling of liquors during
sermon time only. Take as an example the following ordinance&mdash;as
curious for its language as its subject&mdash;dated 4th October,
1598, twenty-four years after Knox's death:</p>

<p>"Item, The prouest, bailleis, and counsall ratefeis and approves
the statute maid obefoir, bering that na mercatt, nather of
fische nor flesche salbe on the Sabboth day in tyme cumming, in

and lykvayes ratefeis the statute maid aganis the playeris in the

and that na tavernar sell nor went any wyne nor aill in tyme

than that of Bownd. Thomas Shepard, of Cambridge, Mass.,
developed from some Sermons on the Subject a work with the
title, Theses Sabbaticæ, or the Doctrine of the Sabbath. After
a considerable circulation in manuscript among New England
students of divinity, it was printed at London in 1650 by request
of all the elders of New England. From the time of Augustine
the prevailing theory of advocates of a Sunday-Sabbath has been
that the fourth commandment is partly moral, partly ceremonial;
but Shepard, who does not stick at small logical or historical difficulties,
will have it wholly moral, by which means he avoids any
option regarding the day. The rest of the Sabbath, according to
this authoritative New England treatise, is to be as strict as it
ever was under Jewish law, and is to be rigidly enforced on the
unwilling by parents and magistrates. In the spirit of a thoroughpaced
literalist Shepard argues through fifty pages that the Sabbath
begins in the evening. He admits that only "servile labour"
is forbidden, but he reasons that as "sports and pastimes" are
ordained "to whet on worldly labour," they therefore partake of
its servile character and are not tolerable on the Sabbath. It
appears from his preface that there were Puritans in his time who
denied the sabbatical character of Sunday and spiritualized the
commandment.</p>

<span class="smcap"><i>SEPARATISM AND THE SCROOBY CHURCH.</i></span></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Importance of the Separatists.</span> To the great brotherhood of Puritans who
formed a party within the church there was
added a little fringe of Separatists or "Brownists,"
as they were commonly called, who did not stop
with rejecting certain traits of the Anglican service,
but spurned the church itself. Upon these
ultraists fell the merciless hand of persecution.
They were imprisoned, hanged, exiled. They were
mostly humble people, and were never numerous;
but by their superior boldness in speech and writing,
by their attempts to realize actual church
organizations on apostolic models, they rendered
themselves considerable if not formidable. From
this advance guard and forlorn hope of Puritanism,
inured to hardship and the battle front, came at
length the little band of New England pioneers
who made a way into the wilderness over the
dead bodies of half their company. The example
of these contemned Brownists led to the Puritan
settlement of New England. Their type of ecclesiastical
organization ultimately dominated the
Congregationalism of New England and the nonconformity
of the mother country. For these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span> reasons, if for no other, Brownism, however obscure
it may have been, is not a negligible element
in history.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Nonconformity in the Church.</span> The great body of the Puritans seem to have
agreed with Bishop Hall that it was "better to
swallow a ceremony than to rend a church," and
they agreed with him in regarding Separatism as
criminal. They were, indeed, too intent on reforming
the Church of England to think of leaving it.
They made no scruple of defying ecclesiastical
regulations when they could, but in the moral
code of that day schism was the deadliest of sins.</p>

<p>In the early part of Elizabeth's reign, before
the beginning of the rule of Whitgift and the High
Commission Courts, Puritan divines slighted or
omitted the liturgy in many parishes. This became
more common after the rise of Cartwright
and the Presbyterian movement, about 1570. <span class="sidenote">Scrambler, Bishop of Peterborough, to Burghley, 13th
April, 1573, in Wright's Elizabeth and her Times.</span> For
example, in the town of Overston, in 1573, there
was no divine service according to the Book of
Common Prayer, "but insteade thereof two sermons
be preached" by men whom the bishop had
refused to license. The village of Whiston was
also a place of Puritan assemblage, "where it is
their joye," writes the Bishop of Peterborough,
"to have manie owte of divers parishes, principallie
owte of Northampton towne and Overston
aforesaid, with other townes thereaboute, there to
receive the sacramentes with preachers and ministers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> to their owne liking, and contrarie to the
forme prescribed by the publique order of the
realme." <span class="sidenote">Rogers's Preface to Articles. Parker Soc. ed., p. 10.</span> Thomas Rogers says, "The brethren
(for so did they style them-selves) would neither
pray, nor say service, nor baptize, nor celebrate
the Lord's Supper, nor marry, nor bury, nor do
any other ecclesiastical duty according to law."</p>

<p>At this time some of the Puritan divines held
high positions in the church. Whittingham, who
had been on the Puritan side of the quarrels in
Frankfort, and who had received only a Genevan
ordination, succeeded in holding his deanery of
Durham until his death, in 1579. In 1563 Dr. Turner
was sneering at bishops as "white coats" and
"tippett gentlemen," while himself Dean of Durham.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Semi-Separatists.</span> But Elizabeth after a while filled the bishoprics
with men to her liking, whose heavy hands made
the lot of Puritans in the church harder and
harder. Many ministers were silenced, but there
were many who, by evasion or by straining their
consciences, held their benefices. <span class="sidenote">Bancroft in Barlowe's Svmme and Svbstance.</span> Some Puritan
clergymen, when they were to preach, preferred
"to walk in the church-yard until sermon time
rather than to be present at public prayer." Some
Puritan laymen had their own way of conforming
to the church. <span class="sidenote">Heresiography, p. 82.</span> "There is a sort of Semi-Separatist,"
says Pagitt, as late as 1646, "that will heare
our Sermons but not our Common-prayers; and
of these you may see every Sunday in our streets
sitting and standing about our doores; who, when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span> Prayers are done, rush into our Churches to hear
our Sermons."</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Causes of Separatism.</span> The growth of Separatist churches was due to
two causes. An almost incredible reverence for
the letter of the Scriptures had taken the place of
older superstitions. There was a strong tendency
to revert to the stern spirit of the Old Testament
and to adopt the external forms of the New. Religious
idealists saw a striking contrast between the
discipline of the primitive and almost isolated bands
of enthusiastic believers in the apostolic time and
the all-inclusive parishes of the hierarchical state
church. And in that age of externalism the difference
in organic form between the Anglican church
and the little synagogues of Christian seceders
founded by Paul in the Levant weighed heavily
upon the minds of earnest people. It did not occur
to them that this primitive organization was
probably brought over from the neighboring Jewish
congregations from which the converts had
withdrawn, and that there might not be any obligation
to imitate it under different skies and in a
remote age. <span class="sidenote">Thomas Scott in Pagitt, 80.</span> The Separatist was an idealist. "He
lives by the aire," said an opponent, "and there he
builds Castles and Churches; none on earth will
please him; ... he must finde out Sir Thomas
More's Utopia, or rather Plato's Community, and
bee an Elder there." But Separatism was undoubtedly
promoted by persecution. Bradford
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span> says that the sufferings inflicted on them by the
bishops helped some of the Puritans "to see further
into things by the light of the word of God. <span class="sidenote">Plimoth Plantation, p. 8.</span>
How not only these base and beggerly ceremonies
were unlawfull, but also that the lordly and tiranous
power of the prelats ought not to be submitted
unto." Drawn thus by the letter of the
biblical record, while stung by cruel oppression
and galled by the opposition of the constituted
authorities to what they deemed the truth divine,
it is not strange that religious enthusiasts began to
long for societies organized like those of the apostolic
age, from which the profane should be excluded
by a strict discipline.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Robert Browne and Brownism.</span> The beginning of Separatism has been commonly
attributed to Robert Browne, a contentious
and able advocate of Separatist doctrines. <span class="sidenote">1581 to 1586.</span> After a
brief and erratic career as an advocate of these
opinions, and after suffering the penalty of his zeal
and proving the sincerity of his belief in thirty-two
different prisons, in some of which he could not see
his hand at noonday, Browne at length began to
waver&mdash;now inclined to return to the church, now
recoiling toward dissent. Worn out in nerves by
controversy and persecution, this eccentric man
was so alarmed by a solemn sentence of excommunication
from a bishop, that he repented and made
peace with the English church. He accepted a
benefice, but employed a curate to preach for him.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span> Browne lingered on to an unhonored age, imperious
and contentious, not able to live with his wife,
and held in no reverence by churchmen, while he
was despised by Separatists. He died at eighty, in
Northampton jail, to which he had been carried on
a feather bed laid in a cart. The old man had been
committed to prison this thirty-third time in his
life for striking a constable who sought to collect
a rate. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c2_1" name="note_b2_c2_1"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c2_1">Note 1.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rise of Separatism.</span> Separatism in some form existed before Browne's
zeal made it a thorn in the side of the bishops.
Something like a separation existed in 1567. <span class="sidenote">Barclay's Inner Life, pp. 13, 53.</span> In
1571 there was an independent church of which we
know little but the pastor's name. <span class="sidenote">Dialogue of 1593 quo. by Waddington.</span> Bradford even
dates independency back to the reign of Mary. In
truth, the rise of this sect, from which came the
earliest New England colony, appears to be lost
in obscurity. <span class="sidenote">Bradford's Dialogue.</span> Significant movements are usually
cradled in rustic mangers, to which no learned
magi think it worth their while to journey. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c2_2" name="note_b2_c2_2"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c2_2">Note 2.</a></span> The
beginning of Separatism was probably in the little
conventicles held by devout Puritans who, in the
words of one of their own writers, "met together
to sing a psalm or to talk of God's word." <span class="sidenote">Josias Nichols, The Plea for the Innocent, 1602, in
Hanbury, i. 3.</span> But
Browne, so far as we know, was one of the earliest
to organize independent churches, with officers
named and classified after those of the petty hierarchies
of the early Christian congregations, or
rather according to such deductions regarding
them as he was able to make from the Epistles of
Paul. Separatism, though it owed something to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span> Browne's activity, was not founded by him.
Browne's labors began about 1581, and his fiery
career as a Brownist had lasted only four or five
years when he began to vacillate. A great part
of this time was spent in exile, much of it in
prison, and very little of it about London. <span class="sidenote">Stephen Breadwell, 1588, in Dexter, 255.</span> But
before 1587 London seems to have been the
center of the Separatists, from which they had
"sparsed their companies into severall partes of
the Realme."</p>

<p>It seems that their rise in London came from
the devout meetings of those who had begun to
repudiate the Church of England as antichristian.
Without any officers or organization apparently,
these people, when we first get sight of them, were
wont to assemble in the summer time in the fields
about London, sitting down upon a bank while the
Bible was expounded now by one and now by another
of the company. In the winter it was their
custom to spend the whole Sunday together from
five o'clock in the morning, eating dinner in company
and paying for it by a collection. They
responded in prayer only by spontaneous groans
or sobs, much after the fashion of the early Quakers,
Methodists, and other enthusiasts of a later
time. <span class="sidenote">H. M. Dexter's Congregationalism, 255-257.</span> If one of their members returned to a parish
assembly, they pronounced him an apostate and
solemnly delivered him over to Satan until he
should repent.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span> V.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Barrowism.</span> When they began to organize themselves formally
into a church the London Separatists in their
turn resorted to the apostolic epistles. These had
already been treated like the magician's bottle that
is made to yield white wine or red at pleasure.
From them whatsoever form of discipline was desired
by Anglican, Presbyterian, or Brownist had
been derived, and now a still different discipline
was deduced, a mean betwixt Presbyterian and
Brownist theories. This is known now as Barrowism.
It was the form of church government
brought by the Pilgrims to Plymouth, and substantially
that which prevailed in New England
throughout the seventeenth century.</p>

<img src="images/img004tb.jpg" width="400" height="324" alt="The cradle of the Pilgrims." title=""></a>
</div>

<p>The London Separatists suffered miserably from
persecution. Many of them languished and died
in prison. Barrow and Greenwood, their leaders,
were hanged at Tyburn. A part of them migrated
to Amsterdam, while the rest maintained a furtive
church in London. <span class="sidenote">Separatists in Amsterdam, 1593.</span> Those in Amsterdam, having
no lingering abuses of the English church to reform,
set every man's conscience to watch his
neighbor's conduct. Having seceded from the
communion of the Church of England on account
of scandals, they were scandalized with the least
variation from their rigorous standard by any of
their own church members, and they were soon
torn asunder with dissensions as the result of this
vicariousness of conscience. The innocent vanity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span> of the pastor's wife who could never forego a
"toppish" hat and high-heeled shoes was the principal
stumbling-block.</p>

<p>Though Separatism had been almost extirpated
from England by the close of Elizabeth's reign,
there remained even yet one vigorous society in
the north which was destined to exert a remarkable
influence on the course of history.</p>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The cradle of the Pilgrims.</span> On the southern margin of Yorkshire the
traveler alights to-day at the station of Bawtry.
It is an uninteresting village, with a rustic inn.
More than a mile to the southward, in Nottinghamshire,
lies the pleasant but commonplace village of
Scrooby. About a mile to the north of Bawtry is
Austerfield, a hamlet of brick cottages crowded together
along the road. It has a picturesque little
church built in the middle ages, the walls of which
are three feet thick. This church will seat something
more than a hundred people nowadays by
the aid of a rather modern extension. In the seventeenth
century it was smaller, and there was no
ceiling. Then one could see the rafters of the
roof while shuddering with cold in the grottolike
interior. The country around is level and unpicturesque.</p>

<p>But one is here in the cradle of great religious
movements. In Scrooby and in Austerfield were
born the Pilgrims who made the first successful
settlement in New England. A little to the east
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span> lies Gainsborough, from which migrated to Holland
in 1606 the saintly Separatist John Smyth, who
gave form to a great Baptist movement of modern
times. A few miles to the northeast of Bawtry, in
Lincolnshire, lies Epworth, the nest from which the
Wesleys issued more than a hundred years later to
spread Methodism over the world. <span class="sidenote">Hunter's Founders of New Plymouth, 24, 25.</span> Religious zeal
seems to have characterized the people of this
region even before the Reformation, for the country
round about Scrooby was occupied at that time by
an unusual number of religious houses.</p>

<p>The little Austerfield church and the old church
at Scrooby are the only picturesque or romantic
elements of the environment, and on these churches
the Pilgrims turned their backs as though they had
been temples of Baal. In the single street of Austerfield
the traveler meets the cottagers of to-day,
and essays to talk with them. They are heavy and
somewhat stolid, like most other rustic people in
the north country, and an accent to which their
ears are not accustomed amuses and puzzles them.
No tradition of the Pilgrims lingers among them.
They have never heard that anybody ever went
out of Austerfield to do anything historical. They
listen with a bovine surprise if you speak to them
of this exodus, and they refer you to the old clerk
of the parish, who will know about it. The venerable
clerk is a striking figure, not unlike that parish
clerk painted by Gainsborough. This oracle of
the hamlet knows that Americans come here as on
a pilgrimage, and he tells you that one of them, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>(p. 151)</span> descendant of Governor Bradford, offered a considerable
sum for the disused stone font at which
Bradford the Pilgrim was baptized. But the
traveler turns away at length from the rustic folk
of Austerfield and the beer-drinkers over their
mugs in the inn at Bawtry, and the villagers at
Scrooby, benumbed by that sense of utter common-placeness
which is left on the mind of a stranger
by such an agricultural community. The Pilgrims,
then, concerning whom poems have been written,
and in whose honor orations without number have
been made, were just common country folk like these,
trudging through wheat fields and along the muddy
clay highways of the days of Elizabeth and James.
They were just such men as these and they were
not. They were such as these would be if they
were vivified by enthusiasm. We may laugh at
superfluous scruples in rustic minds, but none will
smile at brave and stubborn loyalty to an idea
when it produces such steadfast courage as that
of the Pilgrims.</p>

<p>And yet, when the traveler has resumed his
journey, and recalls Scrooby and Bawtry and Austerfield,
the stolid men and gossiping women, the
narrow pursuits of the plowman and the reaper,
and remembers the flat, naked, and depressing
landscape, he is beset by the old skepticism about
the coming of anything good out of Nazareth. <span class="sidenote">Magnalia, Book II, chap. i, p. 2.</span>
Nor is he helped by remembering that at the time
of Bradford's christening at the old stone font the
inhabitants of Austerfield are said to have been "a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span> most ignorant and licentious people," and that
earlier in that same century John Leland speaks of
"the meane townlet of Scrooby."</p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Elder Brewster.</span> But Leland's description of the village suggests
the influence that caused Scrooby and the
wheat fields thereabout to send forth, in the beginning
of the seventeenth century and of a new
reign, men capable of courage and fortitude sufficient
to make them memorable, and to make these
three townlets places of pilgrimage in following
centuries.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Itinerary, i, 36, in Hunter's Founders, p. 20.</span> "In the meane townlet of Scrooby, I marked
two things"&mdash;it is Leland who writes&mdash;"the parish
church not big but very well builded; the second
was a great manor-place, standing within a moat,
and longing to the Archbishop of York." This
large old manor-place he describes with its outer
and inner court. In this manor-place, about half a
century after Leland saw it, there lived William
Brewster. He was a man of education, who had
been for a short time in residence at Cambridge;
he had served as one of the under secretaries of
state for years; had been trusted beyond all others
by Secretary Davison, his patron; and, when Elizabeth
disgraced Davison, in order to avoid responsibility
for the death of Mary of Scotland, Brewster
had been the one friend who clung to the fallen
secretary as long as there was opportunity to do
him service. Making no further effort to establish
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span> himself at court, Brewster went after a while "to
live in the country in good esteeme amongst his
freinds and the good gentle-men of those parts,
espetially the godly and religious." <span class="sidenote">Bradford, 410.</span> His abode
after his retirement was the old manor-place now
destroyed, but then the most conspicuous building
at Scrooby. It belonged in his time to Sir Samuel
Sandys, the elder brother of Sir Edwin Sandys,
whose work as the master spirit in the later history
of the Virginia Company has already been
recounted. <span class="sidenote"><i>Supra</i>, Book I, chap. ii, iii.</span> At Scrooby Brewster succeeded his
father in the office of "Post," an office that obliged
him to receive and deliver letters for a wide
district of country, to keep relays of horses for
travelers by post on the great route to the north,
and to furnish inn accommodations. In the master
of the post at Scrooby we have the first of those
influences that lifted a group of people from this
rustic region into historic importance. He had
been acquainted with the great world, and had
borne a responsible if not a conspicuous part in
delicate diplomatic affairs in the Netherlands. At
court, as at Scrooby, he was a Puritan, and now in
his retirement his energies were devoted to the
promotion of religion. He secured earnest ministers
for many of the neighboring parishes. But
that which he builded the authorities tore down.
Whitgift was archbishop, and the High Commission
Courts were proceeding against Puritans with
the energy of the Spanish Inquisition. "The
godly preachers" about him were silenced. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>(p. 154)</span> people who followed them were proscribed, and
all the pains and expense of Brewster and his
Puritan friends in establishing religion as they
understood it were likely to be rendered futile by
the governors of the church. <span class="sidenote">Plimoth Plantations, 411.</span> "He and many
more of those times begane to looke further into
things," says Bradford. Persecution begot Separatism.
The theory was the result of conditions,
as new theories are wont to be.</p>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Scrooby Church.</span> Here, as elsewhere, the secession appears to
have begun with meetings for devotion. By this
supposition we may reconcile two dates which
have been supposed to conflict, conjecturing that
in 1602, when Brewster had lived about fifteen
years in the old manor-house, his neighbors, who
did not care to attend the ministry of ignorant and
licentious priests, began to spend whole Sundays
together, now in one place and now in another,
but most frequently in the old manor-house
builded within a moat, and reached by ascending
a flight of stone steps. <span class="sidenote">Magnalia, Book ii, c. i, 2.</span> Here, Brewster's hospitality
was dispensed to them freely. They may
or may not have been members of the Separatist
church at Gainsborough, as some have supposed.
It was not until 1606 that these people formed
the fully organized Separatist church of Scrooby.
It was organized after the Barrowist pattern
that had originated in London&mdash;it was after a
divine pattern, according to their belief. Brewster,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span> the nucleus of the church, became their ruling
elder.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The ruling elder.</span> It was in these all-day meetings at the old
manor-house that the Separatist rustics of Scrooby
were molded for suffering and endeavor. The
humble, modest, and conscientious Brewster was
the king-post of the new church&mdash;the first and
longest enduring of the influences that shaped the
character of these people in England, Holland, and
America. <span class="sidenote">Bradford's Plimoth Plantation, 408-414.</span>

<span class="sidenote">Winsor's Elder William Brewster, a pamphlet.</span>
<span class="sidenote">F. B. Dexter in Narrative and Crit. Hist., iii,
257-282.</span> Brewster could probably have returned
to the court under other auspices after Davison's
fall, but as master of the post at Scrooby, then as
a teacher and as founder of a printing office of
prohibited English books in Leyden, and finally as
a settler in the wilderness, inuring his soft hands
to rude toils, until he died in his cabin an octogenarian,
he led a life strangely different from that of a
courtier. But no career possible to him at court
could have been so useful or so long remembered.</p>

<h4>X.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">John Robinson.</span> But Brewster was not the master spirit. About
the time the Separatists of Scrooby completed
their church organization, in 1606, there came to
it John Robinson. He had been a fellow of Emmanuel
College, Cambridge, and a beneficed clergyman
of Puritan views. He, too, had been slowly
propelled to Separatist opinion by persecution.
For fourteen years before the final migration he
led the Pilgrims at Scrooby and Leyden. Wise
man of affairs, he directed his people even in their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span> hard struggle for bread in a foreign country.
He was one of the few men, in that age of debate
about husks and shells, who penetrated to those
teachings concerning character and conduct which
are the vital and imperishable elements of religion.
Even when assailed most roughly in debate he
was magnanimous and forbearing. He avoided
the bigotry and bitterness of the early Brownists,
and outgrew as years went on the narrowness of
rigid Separatism. He lived on the best terms with
the Dutch and French churches. He opposed
rather the substantial abuses than the ceremonies
of the Church of England, and as life advanced
he came to extend a hearty fellowship and communion
to good men in that church. Had it been
his lot to remain in the national church and rise,
as did his opponent, Joseph Hall, to the pedestal
of a bishopric or to other dignity, he would have
been one of the most illustrious divines of the age&mdash;wanting
something of the statesmanly breadth
of Hooker, but quite outspreading and overtopping
the Whitgifts, Bancrofts, and perhaps even
the Halls. Robert Baillie, who could say many
hard things against Separatists, is forced to confess
that "Robinson was a man of excellent parts, and
the most learned, polished, and modest spirit that
ever separated from the Church of England"; and
long after his death the Dutch theologian Hornbeeck
recalls again and again his integrity, learning,
and modesty. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c2_3" name="note_b2_c2_3"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c2_3">Note 3.</a></span></p>

<p>Shall we say that when subjected to this great
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span> man's influence the rustics of Scrooby and Bawtry
and Austerfield were clowns no longer? Perhaps
we shall be truer to the probabilities of human
nature if we conclude that Robinson was able to
mold a few of the best of them to great uses, and
that these became the significant digits which gave
value to the ciphers.</p>

resource of those who sought to involve all Separatists in
his disgrace. Odium has always been a more effective weapon
than argument in a theological controversy. Browne's enemies
alleged that even while on the gridiron of persecution his conduct
had not been free from moral obliquity. I have not been able to
see Bernard's charges on this score, but John Robinson, in his
Justification, etc. (1610), parries the thrust in these words: "Now
as touching Browne, it is true as Mr. B[ernard] affirmeth, that as
he forsook the Lord so the Lord forsook him in his way; ... as
for the wicked things (which Mr. B. affirmeth) <i>he did in the way</i>
it may well be as he sayeth, ... as the more like he was to returne
to his proper centre the Church of England, where he
should be sure to find companie ynough in any wickednesse."
Edition of 1639, p. 50. One of the most learned accounts of
Browne is to be found in H. M. Dexter's Congregationalism, the
lecture on Robert Browne. It is always easy to admire Dr.
Dexter's erudition, but not so easy to assent to his conclusions.

of England, p. 50, edition of 1639, says: "It is true that Boulton
was (though not the first in that way) an elder of a Separatist
church in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's dayes, and falling
from his holy profession recanted the same at Paul's Crosse and
afterwards hung himself as Judas did." Compare Cotton's The
Way of the Congregationall Churches Cleared, p. 4, and various
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span> intimations in Hanbury's Memorials, which imply the existence
of Independent congregations in London and elsewhere in the
early years of Elizabeth's reign. But Hanbury's handling of the
valuable material he collected with commendable assiduity is
sometimes so clumsy that the reader is obliged to grope for facts
bearing upon most important questions. One gets from Hanbury's
notes and some older publications a vague notion that the
Flemish Protestants, recently settled in England in great numbers,
exerted an influence in favor of Independency. Robert Browne
began his secession in Norwich, a place where the people from
the Low Countries were nearly half the population, and Browne
was even said to have labored among the Dutch first. Fuller,

good qualities are very apparent in the wise and tender letters addressed
to the Pilgrims when they were leaving England and after
their arrival at Plymouth, which will be found in Bradford's
Plimoth Plantations, 63, 64, 163. See Bradford's character of him,

Sumner, in 3d Massachusetts Historical Collections, ix, has a
paper giving the result of his investigations in Leyden. He
quotes Hornbeeck as saying, twenty-eight years after Robinson's
death, that he was the best of all the exiles as well as the most
upright, learned, and most modest. Hornbeeck's words are:
"Optimus inter illos." "Vir supra reliquos probus atque eruditus."
"Doctissimi ac modestissimi omnium separatistorum."</p>

<span class="smcap"><i>THE PILGRIM MIGRATIONS.</i></span></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Accession of James I.</span> The accession of James of Scotland to the
English throne in 1603 raised the hopes of the
Puritans. James had said, in 1590: "As for our
neighbour kirk of England, their service is an ill-said
masse in English; they want nothing of the
masse but the liftings." <span class="sidenote">Neal, ii, 28. Compare Burns's Prel. Diss. to Wodrow,
lxxiv.</span> Later, when the prospect
of his accession to the English throne was imminent,
James had spoken with a different voice, but
the Puritans remembered his lifelong familiarity
with Presbyterian forms, and his strongly expressed
satisfaction with the Scottish Kirk. They
met him on his way to London with a petition
for modifications of the service. This was
known as the Millinary Petition, because it was
supposed to represent the views of about one thousand
English divines.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hampton Court conference.</span> In January, 1604, the king held a formal conference
at Hampton Court between eleven of the
Anglican party on one side, nine of them being
bishops, and four Puritan divines, representing the
petitioners. Assuming at first the air of playing
the arbiter, James, who dearly loved a puttering
theological debate, could not refrain from taking
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span> the cause of the churchmen out of their hands and
arguing it himself. <span class="sidenote">Svmme and Svbstance, <i>passim</i>.</span> The reports of the conference
are most interesting as showing the paradoxical
qualities of James, who, by his action at this meeting,
unwittingly made himself a conspicuous figure
in the history of America. The great churchmen
were surprised at the display made by the
king of dialectic skill. They held Scotch learning
in some contempt, and were amazed that one bred
among the "Puritans" should know how to handle
questions of theology so aptly. <span class="sidenote">Prel. Diss. to Wodrow, lxxiv.</span> James, though
he had declared the Church of Scotland "the
sincerest kirk in the world" because it did not
keep Easter and Yule as the Genevans did, now
had the face to assure the prelates that he had
never believed after he was ten years old what
he was taught in Scotland. His speeches in
the conference are marked by ability, mingled
with the folly which vitiated all his qualities.
Quick at reply and keen in analysis, he even shows
something like breadth of intelligence, or at least
intellectual toleration, but without ever for a moment
evincing any liberality of feeling. His manifest
cleverness is rendered futile by his narrow and
ridiculous egotism, his arrogance in the treatment
of opponents, and his coarse vulgarity in expression. <span class="sidenote">Ch. Hist., x, vii, 30.</span>
"In common speaking as in his hunting,"
says Fuller, "he stood not on the cleanest but nearest
way." The Puritans were no more able to
answer the arguments of the king than was Æsop's
lamb to make reply to the wolf. Laying down for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span> his fundamental maxim "No bishop, no king," he
drew a picture of the troubles that would beset him
when "Jack and Tom and Will and Dick" should
meet and censure the king and his council. He
would have no such assemblage of the clergy until
he should grow fat and pursy and need trouble to
keep him in breath, he said. It could not occur to
his self-centered mind that so grave a question was
not to be settled merely by considering the ease
and convenience of the sovereign. "He rather
usede upbraidinges than argumente," says Harrington,
who was present. <span class="sidenote">Nugæ Antiquæ., i, 181.</span> He bade the Puritans
"awaie with their snivellinge," and, in discussing
the surplice, made an allusion that would be
deemed a profanation by reverent churchmen of
the present time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The king and the bishops.</span> With characteristic pedantry he spoke part of
the time in Latin, and his clever refutation of the
hapless Puritans sounded like the wisdom of God
to the anxious bishops. In spite of the downright
scolding and vulgar abuse with which the king
flavored his orthodoxy, the aged Whitgift declared
that undoubtedly his Majesty spoke by the special
assistance of God's Spirit; but one of the worldly
bystanders ventured, in defiance of the episcopal
dictum, to think that whatever spirit inspired the
king was "rather foul-mouthed." Bancroft, Bishop
of London, theatrically fell on his knees and solemnly
protested that his heart melted within him
with joy that Almighty God of his singular mercy
had given them such a king "as since Christ's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span> time the like hath not been seen."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c3_1" name="note_b2_c3_1"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c3_1">Note 1.</a></span> The king
in his turn was naturally impressed with the sagacity
of a bishop who could so devoutly admire
his Majesty's ability, and, when soon afterward a
fresh access of paralysis carried off Whitgift, it was
not surprising that Bancroft should be translated
from London to Canterbury over the heads of
worthier competitors. <span class="sidenote">Compare Nugæ Antiquæ, ii, 25, 26.</span> From the moment of Bancroft's
accession to the primacy the lot of the Puritans
and Separatists became harder, for he plumed
himself doubtless on being the originator of the
high-church doctrine, and he was a man whose
harsh energy seems not to have been tempered by
an intimate piety like that of Whitgift.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Results.</span> <span class="sidenote">Svmme and Svbstance, 35.</span> When James rose from his chair at the close of
the debate on the second day he said, "I shall make
them conform themselves, or I will harry them out
of this land, or else do worse"; and he wrote to a
friend boasting that he had "peppered the Puritans
soundly." <span class="sidenote">Compare Bacon's Certain Considerations touching the
better Pacification of the Church of England.</span> But the king had missed, without knowing
it, the greatest opportunity of his reign&mdash;an
opportunity for conciliating or weakening the Puritan
opposition, and consolidating the church and
his kingdom. James could think of nothing but
his own display of cleverness and browbeating
arrogance in a dispute with great divines like Reynolds
and Chaderton. The conference had been
for him a recreation not much more serious than
stag-hunting. That it was pregnant with vast and
far-reaching results for good and evil in England
and the New World he, perhaps, did not dream.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span> By his narrow and selfish course at this critical
moment he may be said to have sealed the fate of
his son, if not the doom of his dynasty; and his
clever folly gave fresh life to the bitter struggle
between Anglican and Puritan which resulted in
the peopling of New England a quarter of a century
afterward.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The storm of persecution.</span> Every proscription of the Puritans within the
church was accompanied by a crusade against the
Brownists without, who were counted sinners
above all other men. Though Ralegh in 1593 had
estimated the Brownists at twenty thousand, they
were by this time in consequence of oppression
"about worn out," as Bacon said. <span class="sidenote">Bacon's Observation on a Libel.</span> Upon those
who remained the new persecution broke with untempered
severity. Badgered on every side by
that vexatious harrying which King James and his
ecclesiastics kept up according to promise, the little
congregation at Scrooby in 1607 resolved to flee
into Holland, where they would be strangers to
the speech and to the modes of getting a living,
but where they might worship God in extemporary
prayers under the guidance of elders of their
own choice without fear of fines and prisons.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Toleration in the Low Countries.</span> That which is most honorable to the Low Countries,
from a historical point of view, namely, that
their cities were places of refuge for oppressed
consciences, was esteemed odious and highly ridiculous
in the seventeenth century. In one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>(p. 164)</span> plays of that time there is a humorous proposition
to hold a consultation about "erecting four new
sects of religion in Amsterdam." The Dutch metropolis
was called a cage of unclean birds, and a
French prelate contemned it as "a common harbor
of all opinions and heresies." At a later period
Edward Johnson, the rather bloodthirsty Massachusetts
Puritan, inveighs against "the great mingle
mangle of religion" in Holland, and like a
burlesque prophet shrieks, "Ye Dutch, come out
of your hodge podge!" <span class="sidenote">Errours and Induration, p. 27.</span> Robert Baylie, in a sermon
before the House of Lords as late as 1645,
says of the toleration by the Dutch, that "for this
one thing they have become infamous in the Christian
world."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Flight of the Pilgrims.</span> To the asylum offered by the Low Countries
the Scrooby Separatists resolved to flee. The
pack of harriers let loose by James and Bancroft
were in full cry. The members of the Scrooby
church found themselves "hunted and persecuted
on every side," having their houses watched night
and day, so that all their sufferings in times past
"were but as flea bitings in comparison." But the
tyranny that made England intolerable did its best
to render flight impossible. In various essays to
escape, the Separatists were arrested and stripped
of what valuables they had, while their leaders
were cast into prison for months at a time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Pilgrims in Amsterdam.</span> At length by one means or another the members
of this battered little community got away
and met together in Amsterdam. To plain north
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span> country folk this was indeed a strange land, and
one can see in the vivid and eloquent language of
Bradford of Austerfield, who was a young man
when he crossed the German Ocean, the memory
of the impressions which these cities of the Low
Countries made on their rustic minds. <span class="sidenote">Bradford's Plimoth Plantation 16.</span> But "it
was not longe before they saw the grimme and
grisly face of povertie coming upon them like an
armed man, with whom they must bukle and incounter."</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Removal to Leyden.</span> Robinson discovered that he was not of a piece
with those Separatists who had preceded him to
Amsterdam. In one division of these, questions of
whalebone in bodices, of high-heeled shoes and
women's hats, distracted scrupulous minds. In the
other, which came from the same part of England
as Robinson's church, the agitations were
of a theological nature. Questions about the
baptism of infants and the inherent righteousness
of man and the portion of his nature that
Christ derived from his mother, with discussions
of the right of a man to be a magistrate and a
church member at the same time, were seething in
the heated brain of the scrupulous but saintly pastor.
Robinson saw that these controversies would
involve the Scrooby church if it remained in Amsterdam.
In Robinson the centrifugal force of
Separatism had already spent itself, and his practical
wisdom had set bounds to the course of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span> logic. To leave the Dutch metropolis for a smaller
place was to reduce the Scrooby exiles to still
deeper poverty, but nevertheless the Pilgrims fled
from discord as they had fled from persecution,
and removed to the university city of Leyden,
called by its admirers "the Athens of the Occident."
After their departure English Separatism
in Amsterdam went on tearing itself to pieces in a
sincere endeavor to find ultimate theological truth,
but Robinson's people in spite of their poverty
were united, and were honored by those among
whom they sojourned. <span class="sidenote">Bradford's Plimouth Plantation.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Winslow's Relations.</span> Others, hearing of their
good report, came to them from England, and the
exiled church of Leyden was fairly prosperous.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Danger of extinction.</span> But when ten years of exile had passed the outlook
was not a pleasant one. The life in Leyden
was so hard that many chose to return to their
own land, preferring English prisons to liberty at
so dear a rate. The "tender hearts of many a loving
father and mother" were wounded to see children
growing prematurely decrepit under the
weight of hard and incessant toil; "the vigor of
Nature being consumed in the very bud as it
were." Some of the young people were contaminated
by the dissoluteness of the city, others joined
the Dutch army or made long voyages at sea, acquiring
habits very foreign to the strictness of
their parents. The result of a contest between the
rigid Puritanism of the little church and the laxity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> prevalent in Holland was not to be doubted. Human
nature can not remain always at concert pitch.
Intermarriages with the Dutch had already begun,
and all that was peculiar in the English community
was about to be swallowed up and lost forever
in the great current of Dutch life which
flowed about it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Emigration planned.</span> Puritanism was in its very nature aggressive,
even meddlesome. It was not possible for a Puritan
church, led by such men as Robinson, and Brewster,
and Carver, and Bradford, and Winslow, to
remain content where national prejudices and a
difference in language barred the way to the exertion
of influence on the life about them. <span class="sidenote">Compare Winslow in Young, 387.</span> With destruction
by absorption threatening their church,
these leaders conceived the project of forming a
new state where they "might, with the liberty of a
good conscience, enjoy the pure Scripture worship
of God without the mixture of human inventions
and impositions; and their children after them
might walk in the holy ways of the Lord."</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Puritans and American settlements.</span> What suggested in 1617 the thought of migration
to America we do not know. Just twenty
years earlier, in 1597, some imprisoned Brownists
had petitioned the Privy Council that they might be
allowed to settle "in the province of Canada," an
indefinite term at that time. <span class="sidenote">Waddington's Cong. Hist., ii, 113, 114.</span> Francis Johnson with
three others went out in that same year to look at
the land. The voyage was an unlucky one, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> the settlement of Johnson as pastor of the church
in Amsterdam was the result. The persecutions
which followed the accession of Bancroft to the
archbishopric had started as early as 1608 a widespread
agitation among the Puritans in favor of
emigration to Virginia, but, when only a few had
got away, the primate secured a proclamation preventing

<p><span class="sidenote">Condition of Virginia.</span> The year 1617, in which the agitation for emigration
began among the Pilgrims, was the year
after Dale's return with highly colored reports of
the condition of the Virginia colony. It is noticeable
that among the books owned by Elder Brewster
at his death was a copy of Whitaker's Good
Newes from Virginia, published in 1613. Whitaker
was minister at Henrico in Virginia, and was the
son of a Puritan divine of eminence who was
master of St. John's College, Cambridge. It is
possible that he was known to Brewster, who had
been at Cambridge, or to Robinson, who had resigned
a fellowship there to become a Separatist.
Whitaker himself was Puritan enough to discard the
surplice. His Good Newes is an earnest plea for the
support of the colony for religious reasons. "This
plantation which the divell hath so often troden
downe," he says, "is revived and daily groweth to
more and hopeful successe."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c3_3" name="note_b2_c3_3"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c3_3">Note 3.</a></span> At the very time
when the Pilgrims first thought of migrating there
was beginning a new and widespread interest in
Virginia. This was based partly on religious enthusiasm,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> such as Whitaker's book was meant to
foster, and partly on the hope of new and strange
commodities, particularly silk. <span class="sidenote">Inventory of books.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Winsor's pamphlet on Elder Brewster.</span> Even this silk illusion
may have had its weight in a secondary way
with the Leyden people, for Bradford, afterward
governor at Plymouth, was a silk-weaver in Leyden,
and there were two books on silkworms in
Brewster's library at his death.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Alternatives.</span> To European eyes all America was one; even
to-day the two Americas are hardly distinguished
by most people in Europe. The glowing account
of Guiana given by Ralegh helped to feed the new
desire for an American home; and it was only
after serious debate that North America was
chosen, as more remote from the dreaded Spaniard
and safer from tropical diseases. One can hardly
imagine what American Puritanism would have
become under the skies of Guiana. Not only did
the Pilgrims hesitate regarding their destination,
but there was a choice of nationalities to be made.
England had not been a motherly mother to these
outcast children, and there was question of settling
as English subjects in America, or becoming
Dutch colonists there.</p>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Application to Sandys.</span> The Pilgrims preferred to be English, notwithstanding
all. But they wished to stipulate with
England for religious liberty. In this matter they
had recourse to Sir Edwin Sandys, the one man
who would probably be both able and willing to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span> help them. Brewster had lived, as we have seen,
in an old episcopal manor at Scrooby. <span class="sidenote">Hunter's Founders of New Plymouth, pp. 22, 23.</span> Sandys,
Archbishop of York, had transferred this manor by
a lease to his eldest son, Sir Samuel Sandys, who
was Brewster's landlord and brother of Sir Edwin
Sandys. Of Sir Edwin the great liberal parliamentary
statesman, Fuller says, "He was right-handed
to any great employment." In 1617 he
was already the most influential of the progressive
leaders of the Virginia Company, its acting though
not yet its nominal head, and in 1619 he was elected
governor of the Company. Brewster's fellow-secretary
under Davison was a chosen friend of Sandys,
and, in view of both these connections, we
may consider it almost certain that the two were
not strangers. To Sir Edwin Sandys was due
much of the new interest in Virginia. He and his
group seem to have been already striving to shape
the colony into a liberal state.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Failure to secure formal toleration.</span> To meet the views of the Leyden people,
Sandys endeavored by the intervention of a more
acceptable courtier to gain assurance from the
king, under the broad seal, that their religion
should be tolerated if they migrated to Virginia.
But James's peculiar conscience recoiled from this.
He intimated that he would wink at their practices
but he would not tolerate them by public act.
And, indeed, the Pilgrims reflected afterward that
"a seale as broad as the house flore would not
serve the turne" of holding James to his promise.
At the king's suggestion the archbishops were applied
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span> to, but neither would they formally approve
such an arrangement. Nor can one wonder at
their unwillingness, since the most profound, liberal,
and far-seeing thinker of that age, Lord
Bacon himself, was so far subject to the prejudices
of his time that he could protest against allowing
heretics to settle a colony, and could support his
position by a mystical argument fit to be advanced
by the most fantastic theologian. "It will make
schism and rent in Christ's coat, which must be
seamless," he says. <span class="sidenote">Bacon's Advice to Villiers.</span> He even goes so far as to
group Separatists with outlaws and criminals, and
to advise that if such should transplant themselves
to the colonies they should be "sent for back upon
the first notice," for "such persons are not fit to
lay the foundation of a new colony." Much more
fit than is a speculative philosopher to draw the
lines on which practical undertakings are to be carried
forward. The transplanting of English speech
and institutions to America would have languished
as French colonization did, if none but orthodox
settlers had been allowed to fell trees and build
cabins in the forest. Ever since the age of stone
hatchets colony planters have been drawn from the
ranks of the uneasy. <span class="sidenote">Archdale's Carolina, 26.</span> An early Quaker governor
of South Carolina puts the matter less elegantly
but more justly than Bacon when he says: "It is
stupendious to consider, how passionate and preposterous
zeal, not only vails but stupefies oftentimes
the Rational Powers: For cannot Dissenters
kill Wolves and Bears as well as Churchmen?"</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> VII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Relations with the Virginia Company.</span> The liberal and practical mind of Sir Edwin
Sandys harbored none of the scruples of Bacon,
and his more wholesome conscience knew nothing
of the fine distinctions of James and the archbishops
between formal toleration and a mere
winking at irregularities. He embraced the cause
of the Pilgrims and became their steadfast friend,
passing through the Virginia Company successively
two charters in their behalf, and the general order
which allowed the leaders of "particular plantations"&mdash;that
is, of such plantations as the Leyden
people and others at that time proposed to make&mdash;to
associate the sober and discreet of the plantation
with them to make laws, orders, and constitutions
not repugnant to the laws of England. <span class="sidenote">MS. Rec. Va. Co., Feb. 2, 1620.</span> This was a
wide door opening toward democratic government.
The patent given to the Pilgrims was also a liberal
one, and it was even proposed to put into their
hands a large sum of money contributed anonymously
for the education of Indian children, but to
this it was objected that the newcomers would
lack the confidence of the savages. One of the
Virginia Company, possibly Sandys himself, lent
to the Leyden people three hundred pounds without
interest for three years. <span class="sidenote">Winslow's Briefe Narration, Young, 383.</span> When we consider
that the Pilgrims had to pay in their first year of
settlement thirty and even fifty per cent, interest
on their debts, and that this three hundred pounds,
the use of which they received without interest,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span> would be equal in purchasing power to five or six
thousand dollars of our money, we may readily believe
that this loan and the semi-independence
offered them under their "large patent" from the
company, were the considerations that decided
them in favor of emigration after the English Government
had refused a guarantee of toleration,
and the Dutch Government had declined to assure
them of protection against England.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Authors of the Plymouth Government.</span> That group of liberal English statesmen who
were charged with keeping "a school of sedition"
in the courts of the Virginian Company founded
the two centers of liberal institutions in America.
The Earl of Southampton, the Ferrars, Sir John
Danvers, and above all and more than all, Sir
Edwin Sandys, were the fathers of representative
government in New England by the charter of
February 2, 1620, as they had been of representative
government in Virginia by the charter of
November 13, 1618. When the Pilgrims found
themselves, upon landing, too far north to use their
"large patent" from the Virginia Company, they
organized a government on the lines laid down in
the general order of the company. The government
established by them in their famous Compact
was precisely the provisional government
which the Virginia Company in the preceding
February had given them liberty to found "till a
form of government be here settled for them."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c3_4" name="note_b2_c3_4"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c3_4">Note 4.</a></span>
Under this compact they proceeded to confirm
the election of the governor, already chosen under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>(p. 174)</span> the authority derived from the charter, now invalid.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Charges against Sandys.</span> The enemies of Sir Edwin Sandys did not fail
to make use of his friendship for the Leyden people
to do him injury. It was afterward charged that
he was opposed to monarchical government, and
that he had moved the Archbishop of Canterbury
"to give leave to the Brownists and Separatists to
go to Virginia, and designed to make a free popular
state there, and himself and his assured friends
were to be the leaders." <span class="sidenote">Duke of Manchester, papers, Royal Hist. MSS. Comm.
viii, II, 45.</span> That Sandys thought of
emigration is hardly probable, but he succeeded in
establishing two popular governments in America
which propagated themselves beyond all that he
could have hoped to achieve.

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The farewell to Europe.</span> "Small things," wrote Dudley to the Countess
of Lincoln in the first months of the Massachusetts
settlement&mdash;"small things in the beginning of
natural or politic bodies are as remarkable as
greater in bodies full grown." The obscure events
we have recited above are capital because they had
a deciding influence on the fate of the Pilgrim settlement.
It is not within our purpose to tell over
again the pathetic story of that brave departure of
the younger and stronger of the Pilgrims from
Leyden to make the first break into the wilderness,
but courage and devotion to an idea are not common;
courage and devotion that bring at last important
results are so rare that the student of history,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>(p. 175)</span> however little disposed to indulge sentiment,
turns in spite of himself to that last all-night meeting
in Pastor Robinson's large house in the Belfry
Lane at Leyden. <span class="sidenote">Plimoth Plantation, 59.</span> "So," says Bradford, as if penning
a new holy scripture, "they lefte that goodly
and pleasante citie, which had been ther resting
place near 12 years; but they knew they were
pilgrimes and looked not much on those things, but
lift up their eyes to the heavens, their dearest cuntrie
and quieted their spirits." Nor is it easy to
pass over the solemn parting on the quay at Delft
Haven, where, as the time of the tide forced the
final tearful separation, while even the Dutch spectators
wept in sympathy, the voice of the beloved
Robinson in a final prayer was heard and the whole
company fell upon their knees together for the last
time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Robinson's influence.</span> These things hardly pertain, perhaps, to a history
of life such as this. It is with the influences
that are to mold the new life while it is plastic that
we are concerned. Chief of these is Robinson himself,
a Moses who was never to see, even from a
mountain top, the Canaan to which he had now led
his people. He must stay behind with the larger
half of the church. Rising to the occasion, his last
words to this little company are worthy his magnanimous
soul. <span class="sidenote">Winslow's Briefe Narration, Young, 397.</span> He eloquently charged them "before
God and his blessed angels to follow him no
further than he followed Christ." ... He was confident
"the Lord had more truth and light to break
forth out of his holy word." In whatever sense we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span> take them these were marvelous words in the seventeenth
century. Robinson understood the progressive
nature of truth as apprehended by the
human mind in a way that makes him seem singularly
modern. In the same address he declared it
"not possible that ... full perfection of knowledge
should break forth at once." He bade them
not to affect separation from the Puritans in the
Church of England, but "rather to study union
than division." <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c3_6" name="note_b2_c3_6"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c3_6">Note 6.</a></span></p>

<p>Admirable man! Free from pettiness and egotism.
Fortunate man, who, working in one of the
obscurest and dustiest corners of this noisy and
self-seeking world, succeeded in training and sending
out a company that diffused his spirit and
teachings into the institutions and thoughts of a
great people!</p>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The landing.</span> On a chain of slender accidents hung the existence
of New England. Had the claims of Guiana
prevailed, had the tempting offers of the Dutch
changed the allegiance of the Robinsonian Independents,
had the Mayflower reached her destination
in what is now New Jersey, the current of
American history would not have flowed as it has.
A South American New England, a Dutch New
England, or a non-peninsular community of English
Puritans west of the Hudson with good
wheat fields and no fisheries or foreign trade, would
have been different in destiny from what we call
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span> New England, and its influence on events and
national character could not have been the same. <span class="sidenote">Morton's Memorial, 6th edition, p. 22, note.</span>
It will always remain doubtful whether or not
Jones, the captain of the Mayflower, was bribed by
the Dutch, as the Plymouth people came to believe. <span class="sidenote">Compare Asher's History of W. I. Company in Bibl.
Essay.</span>
Nothing could be more probable in view of the
general bad character of the seamen of that time
and the eagerness of one political party in Holland
to secure a foothold for the Dutch in America;
but whether Jones, who seems to have borne a bad
reputation, was bribed, or, as he pretended, became
entangled in the shoals of Cape Cod and turned
back in real despair of finding his way, is of no moment.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c3_7" name="note_b2_c3_7"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c3_7">Note 7.</a></span>
He turned back and came to anchor in
Provincetown Harbor. Here the threats of the
brutal seamen, unwilling to go farther, and the
clamor of the overcrowded and sea-weary passengers
did the rest. To continue longer closely
cabined in the little ship was misery and perhaps
death. Here was land, and that was enough. And
so, after exploration of the whole coast of Cape
Cod Bay, the place already named Plymouth on
John Smith's map was selected for a settlement.
Here the landing was made on the 10th of November,
O.S., 1620. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c3_8" name="note_b2_c3_8"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c3_8">Note 8.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Elements of New England.</span> Camden has preserved to us an old English saying
accepted in the days of the Pilgrims, to the
effect that "a barren country is a great whet
to the industry of a people." It was the wedding
of an austere creed to an austere soil under an
austere sky that gave the people of New England
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span> their marked character, and the severe economic
conditions imposed by the soil and climate were
even more potent than Puritanism in producing
the traits that go to make up the New England of
history.</p>

<h4>X.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Earlier attempts to colonize New England.</span> The unwise management that ruined nearly all
projects for colonization in that age and that produced
such disasters in Virginia, had defeated every
earlier attempt to plant English people on the New
England coast. Gosnold had taken a colony to Elizabeth
Island in Buzzard's Bay in 1602, but the men
went back in the ship in order to share the profit
of a cargo of sassafras. Captain George Popham
was the head of a party that undertook to colonize
the coast of Maine in 1607, but having suffered
"extreme extremities" during the winter, the colonists
returned the following year. In 1615 Captain
John Smith himself set out with sixteen men,
only to be taken by a French privateer. These
and other attempts ending in failure, and many disastrous
trading voyages, led to a belief that the
Indian conjurers, who were known to be the devil's
own, had laid a spell on the northern coast to keep
the white people away. This enchanted land
might long have lain waste if Captain Jones of the
Mayflower, sailing to Hudson River or the region
south of it, had not run foul of the shoals of Cape
Cod.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> XI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sufferings at Plymouth.</span> The Pilgrims suffered, like their predecessors,
from the prevailing unskillfulness in colony-planting.
They had escaped from the horrors of the
Mayflower, but how much better was the wild land
than the wild sea; the rude, overcrowded forest
cabins than the too populous ship? "All things
stared upon them with a weather-beaten face," says
Bradford. The horrors of the first winter in Virginia
were repeated; here, as at Jamestown, nearly
all were ill at once, and nearly half of the people
died before the coming of spring. The same system
of partnership with mercenary shareholders or
"adventurers" in England that had brought disaster
in Virginia was tried with similar results at
Plymouth, and a similar attempt at communism in
labor and supply was made, this time under the
most favorable conditions, among a people conscientious
and bound together by strong religious
enthusiasm. It resulted, as such sinking of personal
interest must ever result, in dissensions and
insubordination, in unthrift and famine.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bradford.</span> The colony was saved from the prolonged misery
that makes the early history of Virginia horrible
by the wise head and strong hand of its leader.
William Bradford, who had been chosen governor
on the death of Carver, a few months after the
arrival at Plymouth, had been a youth but eighteen
years old when he fled with the rest of the
Scrooby church to Holland. He was bred to husbandry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span> and had inherited some property. In Holland
he became a silk worker and on attaining his
majority set up for himself in that trade. He was
still a young man when first chosen governor of
the little colony, and he ruled New Plymouth almost
continuously till his death&mdash;that is, for about
thirty-seven years. He was of a magnanimous
temper, resolute but patient, devotedly religious,
but neither intolerant nor austere. He had a
genius for quaintly vivid expression in writing that
marked him as a man endowed with the literary
gift, which comes as Heaven pleases where one
would least look for it.</p>

<h4>XII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Abolition of communism.</span> After two years of labor in common had
brought the colony more than once to the verge
of ruin, Bradford had the courage and wisdom
to cut the knot he could not untie. During the
scarce springtime of 1623, he assigned all the detached
persons in the colony to live with families,
and then temporarily divided the ancient
Indian field on which the settlement had been
made among the several families in proportion to
their number, leaving every household to shift for
itself or suffer want. "Any general want or suffering
hath not been among them since to this day,"
he writes years afterward. The assignment was a
revolutionary stroke, in violation of the contract
with the shareholders, and contrary to their wishes.
But Bradford saw that it was a life-and-death necessity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>(p. 181)</span> to be rid of the pernicious system, even at
the cost of cutting off all support from England.
In his history he draws a very clear picture of the
evils of communism as he had observed them.

<h4>XIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Significance of Plymouth.</span> Why should the historian linger thus over the
story of this last surviving remnant of the
"Brownists"? Why have we dwelt upon the little
settlement that was never very flourishing, that
consisted at its best of only a few thousand peaceful
and agricultural people, and that after seventy
years was merged politically in its more vigorous
neighbor the colony of Massachusetts Bay? Historical
importance does not depend on population.
Plymouth was the second step in the founding of a
great nation. When Bradford and the other leaders
had at last successfully extricated the little settlement
from its economical difficulties, it became
the sure forerunner of a greater Puritan migration.
This tiny free state on the margin of a wilderness
continent, like a distant glimmering pharos, showed
the persecuted Puritans in England the fare-way to
a harbor.</p>

Good Newes from Virginia is no doubt intended by the
entry in the inventory of Brewster's goods, "Newes from Virginia."
I know no other book with such a title. That Alexander
Whitaker was himself touched with Puritanism, or at least was
not unwilling to have Puritan ministers for colleagues, is rendered
pretty certain from passages in his letters. For instance, he
writes to Crashaw from Jamestown, August 9, 1611, desiring that
young and "godly" ministers should come, and adds, "We have
noe need either of ceremonies or bad livers." British Museum,
Additional MSS., 21,993. (The letter is printed in Browne's Genesis,
499, 500.) In a letter given in Purchas and in Neill, 95,
dated June 18, 1614, he says that neither subscription nor the
surplice are spoken of in Virginia. It has escaped the notice of
church historians that Whitaker's semi-Puritanism seems to have
left traces for many years on the character and usage of the
Virginia church. The Rev. Hugh Jones writes as late as 1724
in his Present State of Virginia, p. 68, that surplices were only
then "beginning to be brought in Fashion," and that the people
in some parishes received the Lord's Supper sitting.</p>

this fact, though he did not state it quite so strongly as I have
put it in the text. It is worth while transferring Neill's remarks
from the New England Genealogical Register, vol. <span class="smcap">XXX</span>, 412, 413:
"The action of the passengers of the Mayflower in forming a
social compact before landing at Plymouth Rock seems to have
been in strict accordance with the policy of the London Company,
under whose patent the ship sailed. On June 9, 1619, O.S.,
John Whincop's patent was duly sealed by the Company, but this
which had cost the Puritans so much labor and money was not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span> used. Several months after, the Leyden people became interested
in a new project. On February 2, 1619-'20, at a meeting at
the house of Sir Edwin Sandys in Aldersgate, he stated to the
Company that a grant had been made to John Peirce and his associates.
At the same quarterly meeting it was expressly ordered
that the leaders of particular plantations, associating unto them
divers of the gravest and discreetest of their companies, shall have
liberty to make orders, ordinances, and constitutions for the better
ordering and directing of their business and servants, provided
they be not repugnant to the laws of England." Bradford, in his
Plimouth Plantation, 90, says they "chose or rather confirmed
Mr. John Carver, ... their Governour for that year"&mdash;that is, for
1620. Mr. Deane, the editor of Bradford, has lost the force of
this by misunderstanding a statement in Mourt's Relation, so
called. See Deane's note, page 99, of Bradford. The statement
in Mourt is under date of March 23d. I quote from the reprint in
Young, 196, 197: "and did likewise choose our governor for this
present year, which was Master John Carver," etc. Young applies
Bradford's words, "or rather confirmed," to this event, and
Deane also supposes that Bradford confuses two elections. Carver
was no doubt chosen in England or Holland under authority
of the charter to serve for the calendar year, and confirmed or
rechosen after the Compact was signed. What took place on the
23d of March was that a governor was elected for the year 1621,
which, according to the calendar of that time, began on the 25th
of March. For the next year they chose Carver, who was already
"governor for this present year," and whose first term was about
to expire. Both Deane and Young failed to perceive the pregnant
fact that Carver was governor during the voyage, and so lost
the force of the words "or rather confirmed." Bradford, in that
portion of his History of Plimouth Plantation which relates to this
period, gives several letters illustrating the negotiations of the
Pilgrims with the Virginia Company. The MS. Records of the
Company in the Library of Congress, under dates of May 26 and
June 9, 1619, and February 19, 1620 (1619 O.S.), contain the
transactions relating to the Whincop Charter, which was not
used, on account of Whincop's death, and the Pierce Charter,
which the Pilgrims took with them.</p>

papers, Royal Historical MS. Commission viii, II, 45. It is remarkable
that the dominant liberal faction in the Virginia Company
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span> is here accused of seeking to do what the Massachusetts
Company afterward did&mdash;to wit, to found a popular American
government by virtue of powers conferred in a charter. That
liberal government in New England had its rise in the arrangements
made with the London or Virginia Company before
sailing, and not, as poets, painters, and orators have it, in the
cabin of the Mayflower, is sufficiently attested in a bit of evidence,
conspicuous enough, but usually overlooked. Robinson's
farewell letter to the whole company, which reached them in
England, is in Bradford, 64-67, and in Mourt's Relation. It has
several significant allusions to the form of government already
planned. "And lastly, your intended course of civill communitie
will minister continuall occasion of offence." The allusion
here seems to be to the joint-stock and communistic system of
labor and living proposed. In another paragraph the allusion
is to the system of government: "Whereas, you are become a
body politik, using amongst your selves civill governmente, and
are not furnished with any persons of spetiall emencie above the
rest, to be chosen by you into office of governmente," etc.,
"you are at present to have only them for your ordinarie governours,
which your selves shall make choyse of for that worke."
That the government under the Virginia Company was to be
democratic is manifest. The compact was a means of giving it
the sanction of consent where the patent and the general order
did not avail for that purpose.</p>

Vnmasked is the only authority for Robinson's address. Dr.
H. M. Dexter has with characteristic wealth of learning and ingenuity
sought to diminish the force of these generous words of
Robinson in his Congregationalism, 403 and ff. But the note
struck in this farewell address was familiar to the later followers
of Robinson's form of Independency. Five of the ministers who
went to Holland in 1637 and founded churches, published in 1643
a tract called An Apologeticall Narrative Humbly Submitted to
the Honourable Houses of Parliament. By Thomas Goodwin,
Phillip Nye, Sidrach Simpson, Jer. Borroughs, William Bridge.
London, 1643. From the copy in the British Museum I quote:
"A second principle we carryed along with us in all our resolutions
was, Not to make our present judgment and practice a
binding law unto ourselves for the future which we in like manner
made continuall profession of upon all occasions." On page
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>(p. 186)</span> 22 Robinson's words are almost repeated in the phrase "they
coming new out of popery ... might not be perfect the first
day." Robinson's early colleague, Smyth, the unpractical, much-defamed,
but saintly "Anabaptist," says in a tract published
after his death, "I continually search after the truth." Robinson
wrote a reply to a portion of this tract. See Barclay's Inner
Life, appendix to Chapter V, where the tract is given. This
holding of their opinions in a state of flux, this liberal expectancy
of a further evolution of opinion, was a trait to be admired in the
early Separatists in an age when modesty in dogmatic statement
was exceedingly rare.</p>

New England Genealogical Register, 1874, identifies the Mayflower
captain with Jones of the Discovery, who was accounted
in Virginia "dishonest." But honest seamen were few in that
half-piratical age. That he was hired by the Dutch to take the
Pilgrims elsewhere than to Hudson River is charged in Morton's
Memorial, and is not in itself unlikely. But the embarrassments
of Cape Cod shoals were very real; a trading ship sent out by
the Pilgrims after their settlement, failed to find a way round
the cape.</p>

Pilgrims the honor due to them. Hutchinson asserts that the
Virginia Colony had virtually failed, and that the Pilgrim settlement
was the means of reviving it. This has been often repeated
on no other authority than that of Hutchinson, who wrote nearly
a century and a half after the event. The list of patents for
plantations in Virginia as given by Purchas, in which appears
that of Master "Wincop," under which the Pilgrims proposed to
plant, is a sufficient proof that Virginia was not languishing.
"These patentees," says Purchas, "have undertaken to transport
to Virginia a great multitude of people and store of cattle."
Virginia had reached the greatest prosperity it attained before
the dissolution of the company, in precisely the years in which
the slender Pilgrim Colony was preparing. It is quite possible
to honor the Pilgrims without reversing the order of cause and
effect.</p>

<span class="smcap"><i>THE GREAT PURITAN EXODUS.</i></span></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Result of the Pilgrim settlement.</span> Men who undertake a great enterprise rarely
find their anticipations fulfilled; they are fortunate
if their general aim is reached at last in any way.
The Pilgrims had migrated, hoping to be "stepping-stones
to others," as they phrased it. They
thought that many like-minded in matters of religion
would come to them out of England, but
the Separatist movement had been worn out by
persecution. There were few open dissenters left,
and the Pilgrims, by their long exile, had lost all
close relations with their own country. Among
those that came to Plymouth from England were
some whose coming tended to dilute the religious
life and lower the moral standards of the colony.
The fervor of the Pilgrims themselves abated
something of its intensity in the preoccupations
incident to pioneer life. The hope of expanding
their religious organization by the rapid growth of
the colony was not fulfilled; discontented Puritans
were not eager to settle under the government
of Separatists, and ten years after their migration
the Plymouth colony contained little more than
three hundred people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>(p. 189)</span> <span class="sidenote">The religious motive.</span> None the less the hope of the Pilgrims was realized;
they became stepping-stones to thousands of
others. Captain John Smith laughed at the "humorous
ignorances" of these "Brownist" settlers,
but, humorous or not, ignorant or not, the "Brownists"
remained on the coast while other emigrants
retreated. In spite of their terrible suffering none
of the Pilgrims went back. This is the capital fact
in their history. A new force had been introduced
into colonization. Henceforth persecuted or discontented
religionists, prompted by a motive vastly
more strenuous and enduring than cupidity, were
to bear the main brunt of breaking a way into the
wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Commercial settlements.</span> The first effect of the slender success at Plymouth
was to stimulate speculative and merely adventurous
migration. From 1607 until the arrival
of the Pilgrims in 1620 no English colony had
landed on the northern coast; but after the Pilgrims
came, fish-drying and fur-buying stations began
to appear on the banks of the Piscataqua and
the coast eastward in 1622 and 1623. These tiny
settlements were germs of New Hampshire and
Maine, the only New England plantations begun
without any admixture of religious motives. A
commercial colony was tried in Massachusetts Bay
as early as 1622, but it failed. There were other
like attempts. In 1624 some men of Dorchester,
headed by John White, the "Patriarch" Puritan
clergyman, sent out a colony to Cape Ann. The
members of this company were to grow maize to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span> supply fishing ships, and in the season the same
men were to lend a hand on board the ships, which
would thus be saved the necessity for carrying
double crews. But this plausible scheme proved a
case of seeking strawberries in the sea and red herrings
in the wood. Farmers were but lubbers at
codfishing, and salt-water fishermen were clumsy
enough in the cornfield. <span class="sidenote">John White's The Planter's Plea, in Young's Chronicles
of Mass.</span> Losses of several sorts
forced the Dorchester Company to dissolve. Four
members of their futile colony, encouraged by
a message from White, remained on Cape Ann.
Removing to the present site of Salem, they waited
at the risk of their lives for the coming of a new
colony from England.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Individual settlers.</span> Solitary adventurers of the sort known on nearly
every frontier were presently to be found in several
places. The scholarly recluse was represented
by Blackstone, who had selected for his secluded
abode a spot convenient to a spring of good water
where the town of Boston was afterward planted;
the inevitable Scotch adventurer was on an island
in Boston Harbor; Samuel Maverick, a pattern of
frontier hospitality and generosity, took up his
abode on Noddle's Island; while the rollicking and
scoffing libertine was found in Thomas Morton,
who with some rebellious bond servants got possession
of a fortified house in what is now Braintree.
Here Morton welcomed renegade servants from
Plymouth and elsewhere. He wrote ribald verses
which he posted on his Maypole, and devised May-dances
in which the saturnine Indian women participated.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> He broke all the commandments with
delight, carried on a profitable trade in selling firearms
to the savages in defiance of royal proclamations,
and wrought whatever other deviltry came
within his reach, until his neighbors could no longer
endure the proximity of so dangerous a firebrand.
Little Captain Standish, whom Morton derisively
dubbed "Captain Shrimp," descended on this kingdom
of misrule at last and broke up the perpetual
carnival, sending Morton to England.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c4_1" name="note_b2_c4_1"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c4_1">Note 1.</a></span></p>

<p>The settlement of New England was thus beginning
sporadically and slowly. If the Massachusetts
Puritans had not come, these feeble and scattered
plantations might have grown into colonies
after a long time, as such beginnings did in New
Hampshire and Maine, and later in North Carolina,
but having no strong neighbor to support
them, it is likely that they would all have been
driven away or annihilated by some inevitable collision
with the Indians.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Puritanism at the accession of Charles I.</span> English Puritanism throughout the reign of
James I had been the party of strict morals, of
austere and Pharisaic scrupulosity, of rigid Sabbath
observance, and of Calvinistic dogmatism.
During that reign it had passed through its last
transformation in becoming a political party&mdash;the
party of anti-Catholic politics at home and abroad.
Because Parliament was on its side, the mere
course of events had made the Puritan party favor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span> the predominance of Parliament, and this brought
it to represent liberalism in politics. By his unconcealed
partisanship, James had contrived to
make the Puritans a permanent opposition suspected
of disliking monarchy itself. Charles I was
even more the antagonist of Puritanism than James.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Later Puritanism conservative.</span> In one other respect the position of Puritanism
had been gradually changed by mere parallax. In
Elizabeth's reign it had been the party of innovation.
It was no longer the party of change in religion
when Charles came to the throne. The
adoption of the Arminian system of doctrine by
many of the High-churchmen, and the reactionary
innovations now proposed by ecclesiastics like
Laud, had left Puritanism to stand for Protestant
conservatism. It was immeasurably the gainer
with the mass of slow-moving people by this
change of relative position. The parliamentary
struggle with James and Charles added to the
religious Puritans a numerous body of political
Puritans who, without much care about religion,
were fain to ally their political discontent with the
discontent of those who resisted ecclesiastical retrogression.
This compact party, powerful after
all its defeats, was bound by its position to cherish
every aspiration for the improvement of morals,
every indignant movement for the suppression of
abuses, and it became the ally of every popular
resentment against royal absolutism or episcopal
encroachment, and the advocate, almost to fanaticism,
of an anti-Spanish foreign policy, and a domestic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>(p. 193)</span> policy in which repression and persecution
of Roman Catholics held first place.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rise of Laud.</span> But the king and the High-churchmen were
the party in possession. Buckingham, in the first
years of Charles, was more than ever dominant at
court, and Buckingham's favorite, just rising above
the horizon, was Dr. Laud, Bishop of St. Davids
at the death of James, and soon afterward translated
to Bath and Wells and then to London. It
soon came to be understood that he was only waiting
for the death of his opponent, Archbishop Abbott,
to take the primacy, much of the power of
which he had already contrived to grasp.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c4_2" name="note_b2_c4_2"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c4_2">Note 2.</a></span> On the
death of Buckingham, Laud succeeded him as
chief favorite at court. The one great and real
service which this able and indefatigable divine
rendered the world is the last he would have
chosen. He was the main spur to the settlement
of Puritan colonies in New England.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Character of Laud.</span> Do our best, we moderns shall hardly avoid injustice
in our opinion of Laud. The changes of
time and the advance of ideas have rendered a
sympathetic judgment of him difficult. Ecclesiastic
above all, he was not, like Whitgift and Bancroft,
a Protestant High-churchman. He sought
to make the English church Catholic and mediæval,
yet he would on no account attach it to Rome.
Like Whitgift, he made the church dependent on
royal authority, and in this he was far removed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>(p. 194)</span> from the earlier churchmen. There was nothing
spiritual in his nature; his personal devotion had
neither agony nor exaltation. He had none of the
mediæval enthusiasm that prompted the vigils of
his contemporary, Nicholas Ferrar, for example,
and elevated the master of Little Gidding to a
saintship, amiable and touching. Notwithstanding
the energy of Laud's devotion, his nature was as
shallow and objective as it was sincere. It has
been remarked that when Laud spoke of the beauty
of holiness he meant no more than decorum in public
worship, the beauty of a well-ordered church
and of proper intonation and genuflexion. He
seemed to touch a modern note when he proposed
to suppress the futile debate between Calvinists
and Arminians because it tended to disturb Christian
charity; but Laud's Christian charity, like his
holiness, was purely external; it was merely quiet
submission to one ritual and one form of discipline.
His relentless, vindictive, and even cruel
temper toward opponents showed him incapable
of conceiving of charity in any spiritual sense. He
disliked controversy because it put obstacles in
the way of uniformity, and he had no taste for
speculative debate because it tended to undermine
authority. His intellect was utterly practical and
phenomenally acute. It was incredibly energetic,
and its energy was intensified by its narrowness.
His attachment to the church had no relation to
the beneficent utilities of the church. The church
was a fetich for which he was ready to die without
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span> a murmur. In his zeal he was reckless of personal
danger and sometimes unmindful of the moral complexion
of his actions. His egotism was so interblended
with his zeal that he could not separate
one from the other, nor can the student of his
character. A disservice to him was an affront to
Almighty God. The very honesty of such a man
is pernicious; a little duplicity might have softened
the outward manifestations of his hard nature.
Unhappily, there was not even indolence or self-indulgence
to moderate his all but superhuman
activity, which pushed his domination to its possibilities,
and, with a vigilance aspiring to omniscience,
penetrated to the minutest details in the administration
of church and state. He even filed
papers giving the elements of the debates on good
works as an evidence of sanctification carried on
between Hooker and Cotton in the cabin meeting-houses
of New England. For the rest he presents
the paradoxes one expects in so marked a character.
While he had no taste for the credulous dogmatism
of his time, he showed a certain relish for
superstitions in recording dreams and omens, yet
he had none of the timidity of superstition. He
was, moreover, fearless in peril, and he faced unpopularity
without flinching. Stubborn and inflexible
with the clergy and the populace, obdurate
and pitiless with those who had offended him or
his king or his church, he was flexible and insinuating
in his relations with those in power. His unworthy
yielding to his early patron, the Earl of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span> Devonshire, in a matter which concerned his ecclesiastical
conscience, gave him a bitter and lifelong
repentance. His complacence to Buckingham, and
his servile devotion to Charles, seem a little despicable. <span class="sidenote">Letter to Selden in Chalmers, art. Laud.</span>
He was even willing at the last to make
terms with Parliament, when it became plain that
Parliament was the new master. Though obsequious,
he was the farthest possible from a coward,
and he accepted death on the scaffold with the
serene composure of a martyr.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Political conditions promote emigration.</span> The great migration to New England set in
soon after the beginning of Laud's ascendency in
the ecclesiastical government of England. It waned
as he declined, and ceased forever with his fall.
There is a witty justness in the phrase by which a
colonial historian dubs Laud "the father of New
England." Other archbishops had contented themselves
with crushing the Separatists, but, with characteristic
boldness and logical thoroughness, Laud
struck at the powerful Puritan party which had
contrived for more than half a century to remain in
the Church of England while protesting against
the discipline and service of the church. The
arbitrary government of the new king, the dissolution
of Parliament, and the imprisonment of liberal
leaders cut off hope of securing church reform
or a relaxation of oppressive laws. <span class="sidenote">Gorges's Briefe Narration.</span> High-church
pulpits resounded with arguments in favor of the
king's absolute authority and the duty of unquestioning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>(p. 197)</span> obedience, while the declared principles of
the king and his court left the property, liberty,
and life of the subject exposed to the rapacity or
the vindictiveness of those in power. In view of
these things, some of the Puritans began to think
the American wilderness a better place of residence
than England.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Religious motives for Puritan emigration.</span> The state of the church was even more a reason
for removal than the oppressions of the government.
Persecution had failed to drive Puritan
ministers or their followers into what they deemed
the capital sin of schism. They hated the domination
of the bishops, communion with the ungodly,
and the absence of a rigid discipline. But they
had been sustained through long years of waiting
by the hope of delivering the church from those
who oppressed and defiled her. They proposed,
whenever they could gain power, to winnow the
chaff from the wheat, and they probably destined
the chaff to swift destruction. But the hope of
seeing a church without spot or wrinkle, prayer
book or bishop, died under the reactionary policy
of Buckingham and Laud, and many came to look
with favor on a project whose full import was only
whispered in the ear, to found in the wilds of
America a "particular church," as they phrased it&mdash;a
new church with a right of priority in a new
land and backed by the sanction of the government
of the country. It was no modern generalized
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span> love of liberty, civil or religious, but a
strenuous desire to find a place where they might
make real their ideal of church organization that
brought the Puritans out of their comfortable nests
in England to dwell in poor cabins in a wilderness.
It is a motive for braving dangers by sea and land
hard of comprehension in our Sadducean age.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fear of judgments.</span> There was one other consideration still more
difficult for men of our day to understand. Political
and military reverses had apparently well-nigh
wrecked Protestantism on the Continent. Many
Protestants in the Palatinate and elsewhere were
making peace by becoming Roman Catholics.
"All other churches of Europe are brought to
desolation, &amp; our sinnes, for which the Lord beginnes
allreaddy to frowne upon us &amp; to cutte us
short, doe threatne evill times to be comminge
upon us." These words are set down in the Reasons
for New England as the second consideration.
In another part of the same paper it is urged that

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rise of the Massachusetts Company.</span> The project for a Puritan colony languished at
first on account of the failure of the semi-Puritan,
semi-commercial Dorchester farming and fishing
colony on Cape Ann; but White of Dorchester
continued to agitate the planting of a colony. He
had, no doubt, efficient help in the proceedings
against the Puritan clergy. <span class="sidenote">Compare The Planter's Plea.</span> From Dorchester the
plan was carried to London, where it soon became,
in the phrase of that time, "vulgar," or, as we
should say, popular. Its countenance to the world,
and especially toward the government, was that of
a commercial venture like the planting of Virginia,
but in its heart it was a religious enterprise. In
March, 1628, the Council for New England gave to
the Massachusetts projectors a patent for lands extending
from the Merrimack to the Charles and
three miles beyond each river. The western
boundary of this tract was the Pacific Ocean, for
holders of grants could afford to be generous in
giving away the interior of an unexplored continent
about which nothing was known but that it
abounded in savages.</p>

<h4>VII.</h4>

<p>In June a small colony was sent to Massachusetts
under John Endecott. The next year another
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span> company of emigrants was added. <span class="sidenote">Leadership and character of Endecott.</span> Endecott, who
was one of the patentees, loved a bold enterprise,
and readily consented to take charge of the forerunners
of the colony. <span class="sidenote">1628.</span> He lacked the moderation
and saneness needed in a leader, and his long career
in connection with Massachusetts was marked from
the beginning by mistakes born of a rash temper
and impulsive enthusiasm. Two of the gentlemen
emigrants who had been named by the company in
London as members of the local Council were not
willing to go to the unexpected lengths Endecott
favored in the organization of the Salem church,
though they were probably Puritans of a moderate
type. They held a separate service with a small
company, using the prayer book. Endecott appears
to have made no effort at conciliation; he
promptly shipped John and Samuel Browne, pack
and prayer book, back to England. This was precisely
the course that even Lord Bacon advised in
the treatment of schismatics who should contrive
to gain access to a colony, and there is no occasion
for surprise that a quixotic enthusiast like Endecott
did not hold broader views than those of a philosopher
of the same period. But Endecott's rash
action endangered the whole enterprise, which required
at this stage the extreme of prudence. <span class="sidenote">Bentley's Description of Salem.</span> The
alarmed managers in England contrived to settle
with the Brownes in private, and the affair had no
other result than to ruin Endecott's reputation for
prudence. Endecott, however, went on fighting
the Lord's battles against the Apollyons of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span> fancy, regardless of results. Soon after his arrival
he marched to the den of Morton, the profligate
master of "Merrymount." In the absence of Morton
he hewed down the profane Maypole in God's
name, and solemnly dubbed the place Mount Dagon,
in memory of the Philistine idol that fell down
before the ark of the Lord. At a later period he
cut one arm of the cross out of the English colors
of the Salem trainband, in order to convert the
Union Jack to Protestantism. One of the many
manifestations of his pragmatical conscience was
his Tartuffian protection of modesty by insisting
that the women of Salem should keep their faces
veiled at church. <span class="sidenote">Eliot's Biography, 195.</span> He was also a leader in the crusade
of the magistrates against the crime of wearing
wigs. A strange mixture of rashness, pious
zeal, genial manners, hot temper, and harsh bigotry,
his extravagances supply the condiment of
humor to a very serious history&mdash;it is perhaps the
principal debt posterity owes him. But there was
a side to his career too serious to be humorous.
Bold against Maypoles and prayer books and
women who presented themselves in church immodestly
barefaced, and in the forefront against
wigs, he was no soldier either in prudent conduct
or vigor of attack. When intrusted with the command
of an expedition to demand satisfaction of
the Pequots, he proved incapable of anything but a
campaign of exasperation. When late in life he
was governor of Massachusetts, and had become,
after the death of Winthrop and Dudley, the dominant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span> political leader, the putting to death of
Quakers left an ineffaceable blot on the history
of the colony he had helped to found. When
the colony was brought to book in England for
this severity, Endecott showed himself capable of
writing one of the most cringing official letters on
record, as full of cant as it was of creeping servility.
In him we may clearly apprehend certain
unamiable traits of Puritanism and of the early
seventeenth century which appear in his character
in exaggerated relief. This hearty and energetic
bigot must have been representative of a large,
though not of the better, element in Massachusetts
Puritanism, for he was chosen to the governorship
oftener than any other man during the continuance
of the old charter government.</p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Leadership of Winthrop.</span> It is a pleasure to turn from Endecott to one
who was, like him, a seventeenth-century man, and
who did not escape the scrupulosity and ridiculosity
of Puritanism, but whose amiable personality,
magnanimity, and qualities of leadership
made him the principal figure in the Puritan migration.
Winthrop, like two or three of the conspicuous
actors in our later history, owes his
distinction to the moral elevation of his character
quite as much as to his considerable mental gifts;
for character multiplied into sagacity is better
than genius for some kinds of work.</p>

<p>He was a late comer in the enterprise. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> year after Endecott had brought over a colony
composed mostly of servants of the company and
of the individual patentees, a second company of
emigrants had been sent over with a commission
to Endecott as governor on the place, assisted by
a council. <span class="sidenote">Rise of the great migration of 1630.</span> A church had been formed at Salem.
Now set in a larger agitation in favor of migration
to New England. The course of events in England
was so adverse to Puritanism that those who
were devoted to that purified church, which was
as yet invisible, except to the eye of faith, began
to look toward America. Every door for public
action in state or church was closed to the Puritans
in England, closed and barred by Courts of
High Commission, by the Star Chamber, and by
the Tower. Into one of the gloomiest rooms of
the latter had lately gone, at the arbitrary command
of the king, that high-spirited martyr to constitutional
liberty, Sir John Eliot. Finding no way
by which to come out again except a postern of
dishonor, Eliot deliberately chose to languish and
die in prison. The almost hopeless outlook at
home, the example set by Endecott's emigration to
New England in 1628, and by that of Higginson's
company in 1629, perhaps also the ever-active
propagandism of "Father White" of Dorchester,
set agoing among the Puritans a widespread interest
in the subject. Some of the leading minds
thought it a noble work to organize a reformed
church in a new country, since, in their view, the
Church of England, under Laud, had taken up its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> march backward. This purpose of planting a
Puritan church in America now began to take the
first place; even the conversion of the Indians,
which had been the chief avowed purpose hitherto,
fell into the background.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c4_4" name="note_b2_c4_4"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c4_4">Note 4.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Winthrop's paper.</span> The manuscript paper entitled Reasons for
New England, to which reference has already been
made, was widely but secretly circulated, and frequently
copied, after a fashion of that time, prevailing
especially in the case of tracts or books of
a kind to shrink from print. It contained arguments
in favor of removing to New England, with
answers to the various objections made against
emigration. Several copies of these Reasons, or
Considerations, have come down to us in various
handwritings, and the authorship has been
attributed now to one, now to another; to Winthrop,
to White of Dorchester, to Sir John Eliot
himself. It appears to have been in its earliest form
the production of Winthrop. There were horseback
journeys, some of them by night, made about
this time for the purpose of secret consultation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His character.</span> Winthrop, a country gentleman of Groton, in
Suffolk, and an attorney in the Court of Wards,
was a strict Puritan, desiring above all a reformed
church and "the ordinances of God in their
purity," as the phrase of the time went. Precocious
in everything, and inclined to ideal aims,
he had been religious from boyhood, had married
at a little over seventeen years of age, and had
been made a justice of the peace while still very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span> young. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c4_5" name="note_b2_c4_5"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c4_5">Note 5.</a></span> He studied divinity, and only the dissuasion
of friends kept him from entering the
ministry. Of judicial temper, he came to be often
consulted upon points of conscience, which gave
much trouble in that age of casuistry and abounding
scruples. His kindly visits to those who were
in any trouble of spirit were highly prized. He
himself makes much of the corruptions of his own
nature and of his juvenile aberrancy, but generosity
and purity of spirit like his are born and
not acquired. His devoutness, accompanied by a
habit of self-criticism in the presence of Infinite
Justice, doubtless gave additional vigor to his
virtues. For the rest, he was a man of independent
estate, of prudent and conciliatory carriage, of a
clear but not broad mind. What, as much as anything
else, fitted him for his function was, that all
his virtues were cast in Puritan molds and all his
prejudices had a Puritan set.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">His influence.</span> When the question of emigration was under discussion
other gentlemen who thought of going
turned to Winthrop as the natural leader, declaring
that they would remain in England if he should
desert them. He was not only the official head,
but he was indeed the soul, of the migration of
1630, and he went to America confident of a call
divine like that of Moses. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c4_6" name="note_b2_c4_6"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c4_6">Note 6.</a></span></p>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cradock.</span> It is a fact worthy of note that the three primary
steps toward the establishment of free government
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> in America were due to Englishmen who did not
themselves cross the sea. The Great Charter of
1618 to the Virginia colony, and the "large patent"
to the Plymouth Pilgrims, were granted, as we
have seen, under the leadership of Sir Edwin
Sandys, Governor of the Virginia Company of
London. The third of the measures which placed
colonial government on a popular basis was due to
the governor of another corporation engaged in
colony planting.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cradock's plan.</span> On the 28th of July, 1629, while Winthrop and
his friends were debating their removal to New
England, Mathew Cradock, a wealthy and liberal
merchant, who held the office of governor, or, as
we should say, president, of the Massachusetts
Company, read in a "general court" or meeting of
the company "certain propositions conceived by
himself," as it is carefully recorded. He proposed
"that for the advancement of the plantation, the
inducing and encouraging persons of worth, quality
and rank to transplant themselves and families
thither and for other weighty reasons"&mdash;reasons
which probably it was not thought best to spread
upon the records, but which were the core of the
whole matter&mdash;for these reasons Cradock proposed
to "transfer the government of the plantation to
those that shall inhabit there," and not to continue
it in subordination to a commercial company in
London. <span class="sidenote">Mass. Records, July 29, 1629.</span> The sorrows of the Virginia colony
under the administration of Sir Thomas Smyth
and the disagreements between the Pilgrims and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> their "adventurers" in London had taught a
wholesome lesson. <span class="sidenote">Sainsbury's Calendar, May 17, 1626.</span> Three years earlier Sir Francis
Wyatt, the best of all the early governors of Virginia,
had set forth in an elaborate report that the
principal cause of the "slow proceeding of the
growth of the plantation" was that the government
had been divided between England and Virginia.
Massachusetts escaped from this embarrassment.</p>

<h4>X.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Evolution of the Mass. government.</span> The evolution of the Massachusetts government
may now be traced through its several stages. A
company was formed, partly of Dorchester men,
but chiefly of residents of London. This company
secured a patent to lands in Massachusetts Bay
from the Council for New England. The patentees
intended both a commercial enterprise and a Puritan
settlement. <span class="sidenote">Hubbard, chap. xviii.</span> They sent Endecott, one of their
number, as agent or superintendent, with a company
of servants and others, to prepare the way for
the migration of other patentees. In March, 1628,
they secured a liberal charter from the king, which
gave them the right to establish in Massachusetts
a government subordinate to the company. The
plan was to settle a government in the form rendered
familiar by that of the Virginia Company.
The Massachusetts Company in London sent a
commission to Endecott as governor on the place,
subject to the orders of the company in England.
A council of assistants was associated with him,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span> but there was as yet no provision for giving the
people a voice in the government. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c4_7" name="note_b2_c4_7"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c4_7">Note 7.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The change of plan.</span> Winthrop and his coterie of gentlemen appear
to have been dissatisfied with the prospect of living
under a government directed from England,
and thus subject to English stockholders and liable
to interference from the court. Cradock had been
a leader and the most liberal investor in the enterprise.
He, no doubt, readily foresaw the great advance
that the colony would make if Winthrop and
his friends should embark their lives and fortunes
in it, and he may have intended to emigrate himself.
The annulling of the charter of the Virginia
Company on frivolous pretexts had shown how
easily the Massachusetts charter might meet the
same fate in a reign far more devoted to arbitrary
government than that of James and entirely hostile
to Puritanism. There could hardly be a doubt
that the charter would be revoked as soon as its
projectors should develop their true purpose before
the all-observing eyes of Laud, who was now
rising rapidly to dominant influence in the government.
It was at this juncture probably that Cradock
conceived his ingenious plan. He would resign
his place and have the officers of the company
chosen from gentlemen about to embark for the
plantation. The charter prescribed no place of
assembling to the company, which had been left
free apparently to make its headquarters at its
birthplace in Dorchester or at its new home in
London. It was also free to meet in any other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span> place. The meetings of the company might therefore
be held in Massachusetts, where the Puritanism
of its proceedings would attract less attention.
The governor and other officers would then be
chosen in the colony; the company and the colony
would thus be merged into one, and the charter
transported to Massachusetts would perhaps be
beyond the reach of writs and judgments.</p>

<h4>XI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Cambridge agreement.</span> No doubt the influential company of friends
who were debating a removal to New England
were informed of Cradock's proposition before it
was mooted in the company on the 28th of July.
The plan was probably thought of in consequence
of their objection to emigration under the Virginia
system. Cradock's proposition was at least the
turning point of their decision. <span class="sidenote">1629.</span> Nearly a month
later, on the 26th of August, the leaders of Winthrop's
party assembled to the number of twelve,
at Cambridge, and solemnly pledged themselves,
"in the presence of God who is the searcher of all
hearts," "to pass the Seas (under God's protection)
to inhabit and continue in New England." The
preamble states the object of this migration. It
was not civil liberty, the end that political Puritans
had most in view, and certainly there is no
hint of a desire for religious liberty. Even the
conversion of the Indian is not uppermost in this
solemn resolve. "God's glory and the church's
good" are the words used. This has the true ring
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span> of the Puritan churchman. The whole pledge is
couched in language befitting men who feel themselves
engaged in a religious enterprise of the
highest importance.</p>

<p>This pledge contained a notable proviso. The
signers agreed to emigrate only on condition that
"the whole government together with the patent
for said plantation" should be transferred and
legally established in the colony by order of the
General Court of the Company, and that this
should be done before the last of the ensuing
month. There was opposition to the removal of
the government, and this peremptory condition
was necessary. Three days later, after a debate,
the company voted that its government should be
transferred to Massachusetts Bay.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Removal of the charter.</span> On the 20th of October Cradock resigned his
governorship and Winthrop was chosen in his
stead. <span class="sidenote">1629.</span> Puritan ministers were at once elected to
the freedom of the company, in order that its proceedings
might not want the sanction of prayer.
The next year the charter crossed the wide seas,
and in 1630 a court of the company was held in
the wilderness at Charlestown. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c4_8" name="note_b2_c4_8"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c4_8">Note 8.</a></span> But a subordinate
government "for financial affairs only" was maintained
in London, with Cradock, the former president,
at the head. This seems to have been an
effectual blind, and probably the king's government
did not know of the flight of the charter
until the Privy Council in 1634 summoned Cradock
to bring that document to the Council Board.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span> Thomas Morton, the expelled master of Merrymount,
writes of the wrath of Laud, who had been
foiled by this pretty ruse: "My lord of Canterbury
and my lord privy seal, having caused all Mr.
Cradock's letters to be viewed and his apology for
the brethren particularly heard, protested against
him and Mr. Humfries that they were a couple of
imposturous knaves." <span class="sidenote">Compare Palfrey, i, 371, and Deane's note in Mass.
Hist. Soc. Proc. 1869, p. 185.</span> Laud had thought to crush
the government of Massachusetts by destroying
the company, whose office remained in London,
with Cradock still apparently its head. <span class="sidenote">Hutchinson's Hist. Mass., p. 31.</span> The archbishop
found too late that he had eagerly pounced
upon a dummy. He devised many things afterward
to achieve his purpose, but the charter remained
over seas.</p>

<h4>XII.</h4>

<p>From the point of view of our later age, the removal
of the charter government to America is the
event of chief importance in this migration of
Winthrop's company. The ultimate effect of this
brilliant stroke was so to modify a commercial corporation
that it became a colonial government as
independent as possible of control from England.
By the admission of a large number of the colonists
to be freemen&mdash;that is, to vote as stockholders
in the affairs of the company, which was
now the colony itself, and a little later by the development
of a second chamber&mdash;the government
became representative.</p>

<p>But we may not for a moment conceive that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span> the colonists understood the importance of their
act in the light of its consequences. In their
minds the government was merely a setting and
support for the church. <span class="sidenote">The main purpose.</span> The founding of a new
church establishment, after what they deemed the
primitive model, was the heart of the enterprise.
This is shown in many words uttered by the chief
actors, and it appears in strong relief in an incident
that occurred soon after the arrival of Winthrop's
company. Isaac Johnston, the wealthiest
man of the party, succumbed to disease and hardship,
but "he felt much rejoiced at his death that
the Lord had been pleased to keep his eyes open
so long as to see one church of Christ gathered
before his death." Here we have the Puritan passion
for a church whose discipline and services
should realize their ideals&mdash;a passion that in the
stronger men suffered no abatement in the midst
of the inevitable pestilence and famine that were
wont to beset newly arrived colonists in that time.</p>

<h4>XIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Influence of Plymouth.</span> One salient fact in the history of the Massachusetts
Bay colony is the dominant influence of the
example of Plymouth. The Puritans of the Massachusetts
colony were not Separatists. No one had
been more severe in controversy with the Separatists
than some of the Puritans who remained in the
Church of England. They were eagerly desirous
not to be confounded with these schismatics.
When the great migration of 1630 took place, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> emigrants published a pathetic farewell, protesting
with the sincerity of homesick exiles their
attachment to the Church of England, "ever acknowledging
that such hope and part as we have
obtained in the common salvation we have received
in her bosom and sucked at her breasts."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Differences among the Puritans.</span> It is to be remembered that these Puritans did
not agree among themselves. Puritanism was of
many shades. There were some, like the Brownes
whom Endecott sent out of the colony, that were
even unwilling to surrender the prayer book. The
greater part of the earlier Puritans had desired to
imitate the Presbyterianism of Scotland and Geneva,
and in Elizabeth's time they had organized
presbyteries. Nothing seemed more probable beforehand
than the revival in New England of the
presbyteries of the days of Cartwright. But what
happened was unexpected even by the Puritans.
The churches of Massachusetts were formed on
the model of John Robinson's Independency.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Effect of emigration.</span> There must have been a certain exhilarant reaction
in the minds of the Puritans when at last they
were clear of the English coast and free from the
authority that had put so many constraints upon
them. There were preachings and expoundings
by beloved preachers with no fear of pursuivants.
The new religious freedom was delightful to intoxication. <span class="sidenote">Roger Clap's Memoirs, 40.</span>
"Every day for ten weeks together,"
writes one passenger, they had preaching and exposition.
On one ship the watches were set by the
Puritan captain with the accompaniment of psalm-singing.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span> Those who all their lives long had made
outward and inward compromises between their
ultimate convictions and their obligations to antagonistic
authority found themselves at length utterly
free. It was not that action was freed from the
restraint of fear, so much as that thought itself was
freed from the necessity for politic compromises.
Every ship thus became a seminary for discussion.
Every man now indulged in the unwonted privilege
of thinking his bottom thought. The tendency
to swing to an extreme is all but irresistible
in the minds of men thus suddenly liberated. To
such enthusiasts the long-deferred opportunity to
actualize ultimate ideals in an ecclesiastical vacuum
would be accepted with joy. What deductions
such companies would finally make from the hints
in the New Testament was uncertain. The only
sure thing was that every vestige of that which
they deemed objectionable in the English church
would be repressed, obliterated, in their new organization.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b2_c4_9" name="note_b2_c4_9"></a><a href="#anote_b2_c4_9">Note 9.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rise of the Congregational form in New England.</span> With the evils and abuses of the English church
more and more exaggerated in their thoughts, the
sin of separation readily came to seem less heinous
than before. There was no longer any necessity
for professing loyalty to the church nor any
further temptation to think ill of those at Plymouth,
who, like themselves, had suffered much to
avoid what both Separatists and Puritans deemed
unchristian practices. A common creed and common
sufferings, flight from the same oppression to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span> find refuge in what was henceforth to be a common
country, drew them to sympathy and affection
for their forerunners at Plymouth. The Plymouth
people were not backward to send friendly help
to the newcomers. The influence of the physician
sent from Plymouth to Endecott's party in the prevailing
sickness soon persuaded the naturally radical
Endecott to the Plymouth view of church government.
Winthrop's associates, or the greater
part of them, drifted in the same direction, to their
own surprise, no doubt. There was a lack of uniformity
in the early Massachusetts churches and
some clashing of opinion. <span class="sidenote">Cotton to Salonstall in Hutch. Papers.</span> Some ministers left the
colony dissatisfied; one or more of the churches
long retained Presbyterian forms, and some stanch
believers in presbyterial government lamented
long afterward that New England ecclesiastical
forms were not those of the Calvinistic churches
of Europe. <span class="sidenote">Hubbard's Hist. of New Eng., 117.</span> But the net result was that Robinsonian
independency became the established religion
in New England, whence it was transplanted
to England during the Commonwealth, and later
became the prevailing discipline among English
dissenters.</p>

<p>Thus the church discipline and the form of
government in Massachusetts borrowed much from
Plymouth, but the mildness and semi-toleration&mdash;the
"toleration of tolerable opinions"&mdash;which Robinson
had impressed on the Pilgrims was not so

its own, and of some rather violent and amusing discussion even
in our times. Morton's New English Canaan has been edited by
Mr. C. F. Adams for the Prince Society. His defensive account
of himself leaves the impression that the author was just the sort
of clever and reckless rake who is most dangerous to settlements
in contact with savages, and who might be expelled neck and
heels from a frontier community holding no scruples of a Puritan
sort. The Royal Proclamation in Rymer's Foedera, xvii, 416
(and Hazard's State Papers, i, 151), 1622, sets forth the evil of
the sale of arms to the savages, but it was leveled at earlier
offenders than Morton. Compare Sainsbury's Calendar, September
29 and November 24, 1630, pp. 120, 122. There are also
references, more or less extended, to Morton in the Massachusetts
Records, Winthrop's Journal, Bradford's Plimouth Plantation,
Dudley's Letter to the Countess of Lincoln in Young's
Chronicles of Massachusetts, and in other early accounts.</p>

with a bitter pen, no doubt, but the student Laud, as Abbott

severe Censures in Star Chamber, and the greatness of the Fines,
and the rigorous Proceedings to impose Ceremonies, the suspending
and silencing Multitudes of Ministers, for not reading in
the Church the Book for Sports to be exercised on the Lord's
day, caused many of the Nation, both Ministers and others, to
sell their Estates, and to set Sail for New England (a late Plantation
in America), where they hold a Plantation by Patent from
the King." Part II, vol. i, p. 410.</p>

Plantation, by endeavouring to bring the Indians to a knowledge
of the Gospel." Cradock's letter to Endecott, February 16, 1629,
Young's Chronicle, 133; also the official letter, ibid., page 142,
where the "propagation of the Gospel" among whites and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span> Indians is the "aim." The Royal Charter itself declared that
"to win and invite the natives of the country to the knowledge
and obedience of the only true God and Saviour of mankind ... is
the principal end of this Plantation." (A similar provision was
inserted in the Connecticut Charter in 1662, in imitation of that
of Massachusetts.) The common seal of the Massachusetts
colony, sent over in 1629, bore an Indian with the inscription,
"Come over and help us." Young's Chronicles of Massachusetts,
155, Instructions to Endecott. The paper of "Reasons," attributed
to Winthrop, keeps the conversion of the Indians in view,
but it is blended with that which was in his mind the main end,
the founding of a Puritan church. The first paragraph reads,
"It will be a service to the Church of great consequence to carry
the Gospell into those parts of the world, to helpe on the
comminge of the fullnesse of the Gentiles, &amp; to raise a Bulworke
against the kingdome of Ante-Christ which the Jesuites labour to
reare up in those parts." Life and Letters of Winthrop, i, 309.
The copy of this paper in Sir John Eliot's handwriting has a
preamble written in a nervous style that may well be Eliot's own.
This preamble goes back to the conversion of the Indians as a
main purpose. The Antapologia of T. Edwards, 1644, declares
that White of Dorchester and others had the conversion of the
Indians in view in promoting emigration to New England.
Edwards says, page 41, that the establishing of Congregational
churches "was not in the thoughts of them that were the first
movers in that or of the ministers that were sent over in the
beginning." The statement is quite too strong, but the ecclesiastical
purpose seems to have grown rapidly when the number
of emigrants revealed the greatness of the opportunity.</p>

that prescribed for "particular plantations" in the general
order of the Virginia Company at the time the charter for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span> Pilgrim colony was granted, and like that which was formed at
Plymouth under the Compact. The Massachusetts form may
have been borrowed from Plymouth. This may be considered
the primary form of colony government in the scheme of the
Virginia Company. The plan antedates the formation of the
Virginia Company by at least twenty years, for it was a form
proposed by Ralegh when, in 1587, he organized his colony under
the title: "The Governor and Assistants of the city of Ralegh
in Virginia." The secondary form of government was that prescribed
for Virginia in the charter of 1618, which added a lower
house elective by the people. This fully developed government
could come only when the population had become large enough
to render a representative system possible.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b2_c4_8" name="anote_b2_c4_8"></a><a href="#note_b2_c4_8">Note 8, page 210.</a></span> It has been maintained by several writers that the charter had
been worded with a view to removal. See, for example, Palfrey's
New England, i, 307. But a paper read before the Massachusetts
Historical Society, and printed in the Proceedings for December,
1869, by the late Charles Deane, shows that such a presumption
is groundless. In calling the subordinate government
of Endecott "London's Plantation in Massachusetts Bay in New
England," the company showed that it proposed to keep its headquarters
in London. It is open to question, however, whether
Deane does not go too far in denying that the charter gave
authority for the transfer. In that technical age the letter of the
instrument would probably be counted more conclusive than at
present, and the evidence of the dockets would have less weight.
The removal of the government was not one of the charges made
in the <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings against the company. On the
main question compare also the very significant treatment of the
subject by Winthrop in his paper on Arbitrary Government, Life
and Letters, ii, 443, where he expressly says that it was intended
to have the chief government in England, "and with much difficulty
we gott it abscinded." It is to be remembered that the
exercise of governmental functions by a commercial corporation
was not a novel spectacle in that age. In 1620 the English and
Dutch East India Companies, after having been at war while the
two nations were allies, concluded a treaty of peace. No doubt
the exercise of such powers by trading companies had been made
familiar by the mingling of the functions of government with
those of commerce by the merchants of the Hanse cities. The
East India and the Hudson Bay Companies continued to exercise
territorial jurisdiction until a very recent period.</p>

well exemplified in the church covenant adopted at Dorchester,
Mass., in 1636, under the lead of Richard Mather, which contains
these words: "We do likewise promise by his Grace
assisting us, to endeavour the establishing amongst ourselves all
His Holy Ordinances which He hath appointed for His church
here on Earth, ... opposing to the utmost of our power whatsoever
is contrary thereto and bewailing from our Hearts our own
neglect hereof in former times and our poluting ourselves therein
with any Sinful Invention of men." Blake's Annals of Dorchester.
Robinson of Leyden, in his Justification of Separation, 1610, declared
that the Puritans would soon separate if they might have
the magistrates' license; and Backus, who quotes the passage (i,
pp. 2, 3), remarks on the confirmation which the history of Massachusetts
gives to Robinson's theory of conformity.</p>

drove Cotton to assert that Plymouth had small share in fixing
the ecclesiastical order of Massachusetts, but he is compelled to
admit its influence. "And though it bee," he says, "very likely,

<span class="smcap">CENTRIFUGAL FORCES IN COLONY-PLANTING.</span></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER THE FIRST.<br>
<span class="smcap"><i>THE CATHOLIC MIGRATION.</i></span></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Centrifugal forces.</span> At every new stage in the history of the American
settlement, we are afresh reminded that colonies
are planted by the uneasy. The discontent
that comes from poverty and financial reverse, that
which is born of political unrest, and that which
has no other cause than feverish thirst for novelty
and hazardous adventure, had each a share in impelling
Englishmen to emigrate. But in the seventeenth
century religion was the dominant concern&mdash;one
might almost say the dominant passion&mdash;of
the English race, and it supplied much the most
efficient motive to colonization. Not only did it
propel men to America, but it acted as a distributing
force on this side of the sea, producing secondary
colonies by expelling from a new plantation
the discontented and the persecuted to make fresh
breaks in the wilderness for new settlements. Connecticut
and Rhode Island were secondary plantings
of this kind. Religious differences also made
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span> twain the Chesapeake region, the first home of the
English in America, one of the two rival colonies
being intolerantly Protestant, the other a home
for Catholic refugees.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Character of George Calvert.</span> George Calvert, the first Baron Baltimore, who
projected the Maryland colony and left it to his
son to carry forward, belonged to the order of
men who are shrewd without being creative&mdash;men
of sagacity as differentiated from men of ideas.
The man in whose mind there is a ferment of original
ideas has theories to promulgate or expound.
Sagacity has small necessity for speech&mdash;its very
reticence gives an advantage in the conduct of
affairs. The parliamentary antagonist and political
rival who confronted Calvert was no other than
our old acquaintance Sir Edwin Sandys, of the
Virginia Company. Calvert and Sandys were
alike men of rare accomplishments, and both were
interested in schemes for colonization; otherwise
they were antipodal. Sandys was a statesman of
advanced ideas, creative, liberal, and original, fitted
to be the founder of representative government
in the English colonies. In that age of worn
and brittle institutions it was not deemed wholly
safe to suffer so robust a thinker as Sandys to be
always at large, and it was one of Calvert's most
difficult duties, as the king's secretary and chosen
intermediary, to explain to Parliament why its
leader was under restraint. Sandys, as we have
already said, was described as "right-handed to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span> every great employment"; when Calvert came
upon the scene, he was aptly characterized as "a
forward and knowing person in matters relating to
the state." The phrase denotes, perhaps, clever
adroitness within the limits of that mediocrity which
in those perilous times was a safeguard to the man
who ventured into politics. After having started
well at court, Sandys had fallen into irretrievable
disfavor by his resolute advocacy of the liberties
of his countrymen. The message to the Virginia
Company, already recited, "Choose the devil, but
not Sir Edwin Sandys," expressed the depth of the
king's antipathy. But if Sandys seemed to the
king a devil, Calvert became for him a convenient
angel. Notions about human rights and the liberty
of Parliament did not obstruct Calvert's career.
Not that he was a man to prove unfaithful to his
convictions, as did his bosom friend Wentworth,
or to suppress liberal opinions in order to smooth
an ascending pathway, as did his great contemporary
Bacon. Calvert played a far simpler part
and one less dishonorable. It was his fortune to
be a man of facile mind, naturally reverential
toward authority. The principles enunciated by
his sovereign and the measures by which those in
power sought to attain the end in view were pretty
sure to seem laudable or at least excusable to him.
Such a mind can not be called scrupulous, neither
is it consciously dishonest. The quality most
highly esteemed at the court of James was
fidelity, unswerving devotion to the interests of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span> the king and of one's friends. And this, the
dominant virtue of his time and of his class&mdash;this
honor of a courtier&mdash;Calvert possessed in a high
degree; it is a standard by which he has a right
to be judged. To a French ambassador he seemed
an honorable, sensible, courteous, well-intentioned
man, devoted to the interests of England, but without
consideration or influence.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Calvert's rise.</span> Whatever his lack of influence in councils of
state, Calvert's fidelity, useful abilities, and many
accomplishments won the friendship of James, and
in that lavish reign when all the fairy stories came
true at a court which was "like a romance of
knight errantry," as the Spanish minister declared,
the favor of the king was sure to result in good
fortune to the favorite.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_1" name="note_b3_c1_1"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_1">Note 1.</a></span> From being secretary to
Burleigh, Calvert rose to be principal Secretary of
State, was knighted, and at last ennobled. Grants
of estates in Ireland and of great unexplored tracts
of territory in the wilderness of America, pensions,
sinecure offices, grants of money out of increased
customs fees, and presents from those who had
ends to serve at court, were the means by which
a successful courtier bettered his estate, and by
some or all of these Secretary Calvert thrived.
That he did thrive is proved by the great sum he
was able to lose in his futile attempt to plant a
colony in Newfoundland. It was believed that he
had accepted a share of the money dispensed lavishly
in presents and pensions to English courtiers
by Spain, but this Calvert denied, and one can believe
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span> that a man of his fidelity to king and country
would be able to resist a temptation to which
others succumbed. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_2" name="note_b3_c1_2"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_2">Note 2.</a></span></p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The colony of Avalon.</span> Calvert was very early interested in colonization.
He was a member of the Virginia Company
in 1609, and later one of the councilors for New
England. <span class="sidenote">Cal S. P. America, pp. 25, 26, March 16, 1620.</span> In 1620 he was one of a commission appointed
to settle the affairs of a Scotch company
for colonizing Newfoundland, and in the next year
he dispatched his first colony to the southeastern
peninsula of that island which he had bought from
Sir William Vaughan. In this latter year (1621) he
secured a grant of the whole vast island, but in
1622 he accepted a re-grant of the peninsula alone,
and this became his first proprietary colony. Captain
Whitbourne's pamphlet on Newfoundland was
just then circulating gratuitously by the aid of collections
made in the churches with the sanction of
royal authority. It described a Newfoundland of
Edenic fruitfulness. Even cool-headed statesmen
like Calvert appear to have been captivated by the
stories of this veteran seaman and weather-beaten
romancer. Calvert called his new province Avalon.
The name signifies the land of apples&mdash;that is, the
fruitful country. In old British mythology it was
the paradise of the blessed, the island in the western
seas to which King Arthur was translated in
the famous legend. This name of promise suited
the situation of the new island state, and fitted well
the enthusiastic tales of Whitbourne and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>(p. 225)</span> groundless hopes of Calvert. The bleak Newfoundland
coast had already blossomed with fanciful
names; there was the Bay of Plesaunce and
the Bay of Flowers, Robin Hood's Bay and the
River of Bonaventure; there was the Harbor of
Formosa and the Harbor of Heartsease.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_3" name="note_b3_c1_3"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_3">Note 3.</a></span> Avalon,
the earthly paradise, was but the complement of these.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The charter of Avalon.</span> Sir George Calvert probably drafted with his
own hand&mdash;the hand of an expert and accomplished
man of the court&mdash;the charter of April 7,
1623, that conferred on him an authority little
short of sovereignty over his new territory. This
masterpiece of dexterous charter-making afforded
a model for other proprietary charters, and Calvert
himself bettered it but little in the Maryland
charter of a later date. The ambiguous passages
in the Maryland charter, which have been accounted
evidence of a design to make way for the
toleration or even the possible dominance of Roman
Catholicism, appear already in the charter of
Avalon. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_4" name="note_b3_c1_4"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_4">Note 4.</a></span> Was the colony of 1621 or its charter of
1623 intended to supply a refuge, if one should
be needed, for Englishmen of the Catholic faith?
The question is not easily answered. The primary
design of the Avalon colony was, no doubt, to
better the fortunes of Sir George Calvert and to
lift him and his successors into the authority and
dignity of counts-palatine in the New World. But
there can hardly be a doubt that, before the charter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>(p. 226)</span> of 1623 was granted, Secretary Calvert was
already a Catholic, secretly or latently, if not
overtly. His charter of Avalon naturally left open
a door for the toleration of the faith to which he
was already attached, or toward which he was
tending. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_5" name="note_b3_c1_5"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_5">Note 5.</a></span></p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Calvert's conversion.</span> Calvert's conversion was almost inevitable. He
favored the project for the Spanish match, and he
was, like some other courtiers, under the influence
of Gondomar, a consummate master of intrigue.
He was bound by ties of friendship, and later by
the marriage of his son, to Lord Arundel of
Wardour, a Catholic, and the constitution of his
mind and all the habits of a lifetime made him a
lover of authority in church and state. Under favoring
circumstances such a man becomes a Roman
Catholic by gravitation and natural affinity.</p>

<p>There was a Catholic revival in England at this
time, especially among the courtiers and upper
classes. In 1623 there was a large influx to England
of priests and Jesuits. English Romanists
flocked to the vicinage of London, and resorted in
great numbers to the mass in the houses of foreign
ambassadors; and in many English country houses
the mass was openly celebrated in defiance of law. <span class="sidenote">Petition in Rushworth, Part I, i, 141. Compare Neal,
Part II, c. ii.</span>
The Commons, in alarm, adopted what James fitly
called "a stinging petition against the papists."</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>(p. 227)</span> VI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">His resignation.</span> Calvert had staked his hopes for himself and
for English Catholicism on the Spanish match.
This otherwise pliant courtier was intractable
where his religious convictions were concerned. <span class="sidenote">1624.</span>
He scrupled to draw back at the bidding of
Charles and Buckingham, when drawing back involved
a violation of the treaty oath of the king
and council, the plunging of England into a Spanish
war, the sacrifice of the interests of the Catholic
church, and a fresh exposure of his co-religionists
in England to a harsh persecution. Calvert
was one of that party in the junta for Spanish affairs
which was unwilling to break a solemn treaty
in order to gratify the wounded vanity of Buckingham
and Charles, and he paid dearly for his
firmness. To bring about his resignation, his antagonists
diverted business from his office, thus
reducing his fees and subjecting his pride to mortification.
Under this treatment it was noted by a
letter writer of the time that Mr. Secretary Calvert
"droops and keeps out of the way." It was
reported that he was ill, and then that he had been
rebuked by the king and the prince, and it was
known that he wished to sell his office to some one
acceptable to Buckingham. Calvert's cleverness
as a courtier did not fail him in his fall. He succeeded
at the last in mollifying Buckingham, whose
consent he gained to the sale of the secretaryship.
After nearly a year of the prolonged agony of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span> holding office in disfavor, he resigned in February,
1625, receiving six thousand pounds for his office,
which was worth to the incumbent two thousand a
year. <span class="sidenote">1625.</span> He was at the same time raised to the Irish
peerage as Baron Baltimore. He made his religious
scruples the ostensible reason for his resignation,
and he was already known to be "infinitely
addicted to the Catholic faith." He made no secret
of his proscribed religion; he exposed to visitors
the altar, chalice, and candlesticks in his best
room; and he catechised his children assiduously
in the doctrines of the ancient church. At the
accession of Charles he retired from the Privy
Council rather than take an oath offensive to his
conscience. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_6" name="note_b3_c1_6"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_6">Note 6.</a></span></p>

<h4>VII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Calvert deserts Newfoundland.</span> During the period of his decline from court
favor Calvert's colony of Avalon probably suffered
from neglect. He now gave his new leisure to the
work of rescuing it. In 1627 he made a voyage
to Newfoundland, taking a company of Catholic
settlers and two priests. He went again in 1628.
From Newfoundland he wrote to one of the Jesuits
in England a letter of affection, declaring
his readiness to divide with him "the last bit"
he had in the world. In Avalon began the long
chapter of the troubles of the Baltimores with the
Puritan opposition. Besides his contentions with
Puritan settlers, who abhorred the mass as a Jewish
prophet did idolatry, he found it necessary to
fight with French privateers bent on plunder. <span class="sidenote">Letters of Wynne, Daniel, and Hoskins, in Whitbourne's
second ed.</span> By
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span> the time the almost interminable Newfoundland
winter had begun, he discovered that Avalon was
not the earthly paradise it appeared in the writings
of pamphleteers and in the letters of his
own officeholders interested only in the continuance
of their salaries. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_7" name="note_b3_c1_7"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_7">Note 7.</a></span> The icy Bay of Plesaunce
and the bleak Bay of Flowers mocked him with
their names of delight; of little avail was the fast-bound
River of Bonaventure to its unlucky lord,
or the Harbor of Heartsease to him who had sunk
a fortune of thirty thousand pounds in the fruitless
attempt to plant a settlement on a coast so cold.
Ill himself, and with half his company down with
scurvy, some of them dying, Baltimore turned his
thoughts toward Virginia, now, after all its trials,
prosperous under a genial sun.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sails to Virginia.</span> He knew the conditions of that colony and the
opportunities it afforded. A member of the Virginia
Company during nearly all the years of its
stormy existence, he had been made one of the
fifty-six councilors that took over its effects at its
demise, and he was one of the eight who constituted
the quorum, and who probably transacted
the business of this Council for Virginia. <span class="sidenote">Rymer's F&oelig;dera, tom. vii, iv, 147.</span> Even
under the government of the Company there had
been precedents for the establishment of a "precinct"
within Virginia independent of the Jamestown
government. Such a plantation had been
that of Captain Martin and that proposed by Rich
and Argall, and a charter for such had been given
to the Leyden pilgrims. Baltimore wrote to ask
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>(p. 230)</span> for a precinct, pleading the king's promise already
made that he might choose a part of Virginia.
Here he would still be the head of a little independent
state&mdash;a state in which the mass might
be said without molestation. Before another winter
set in he abandoned Avalon to fishermen and
such hardy folk, and took ship for the James
River, where he arrived in October, 1629.</p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Virginia antagonism.</span> Baltimore's reception in Virginia was most inhospitable.
He had perhaps counted on his former
relation to the colony as a councilor to assure him
a welcome. But the Virginians of that time were
Sandys and Southampton men. They may have
remembered that Calvert had been Sandys's enemy
and political rival, and that he belonged to the
faction of Sir Thomas Smyth in the company.
The members of that faction had been the executioners
of the company when they could no longer
control it. Calvert was one of the later council,
which had tried to take away insidiously the privileges
granted to Virginians by their charter from
the Virginia Company. This attack on their liberties
they had stoutly resisted, even to cutting off a
piece of one of the ears of the clerk of their own
assembly for abetting it. Now a nobleman of the
detested faction, an advocate of absolute government
and a close friend of the king, had come
among them. Baltimore might easily expect to
secure the governorship of Virginia itself.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_8" name="note_b3_c1_8"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_8">Note 8.</a></span> Perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>(p. 231)</span> it is hardly necessary to go even so far
afield for a motive. The prospect of a settlement
of Roman Catholics within the limits of the
colony was in itself enough to excite the opposition
of the Virginia churchmen. Baltimore's
party of Catholics was not the only one repelled
from Virginia about this time. Soon after Lord
Baltimore's visit, perhaps, or just before, the Virginians
refused permission to a company of Irish
Catholics to settle within their bounds. These appear
to have gone afterward to the island of St.
Christopher's, where again Protestant fellow-colonists
fell out with them about religion, so that they
were finally sent to settle the neighboring island of
Montserrat. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_9" name="note_b3_c1_9"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_9">Note 9.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Character of the early Virginians.</span> The Virginians, after all their sufferings, were
now prosperous in a gross way, reaping large
profits from tobacco, and living in riotous profusion
after the manner of men beginning to emerge from
the hardships and perils of a pioneer condition into
sudden opulence. <span class="sidenote">Leah and Rachel, and De Vries Voyages, <i>passim</i>.</span> Their rude living did not at all
prevent the colonists from being fastidious about
their religion&mdash;it was the seventeenth century.
Most of the Virginia clergy at this period were as
reckless in life as the people, but the Protestantism
of the colony was incorruptible. Some of the rabble
even showed their piety by railing at the newly
arrived papist nobleman.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Expulsion of Baltimore.</span> A weapon of defense against Baltimore was
ready to hand. Three years before his coming instructions
had been sent from England to Yeardley
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>(p. 232)</span> to proffer the oath of supremacy "to all such as
come thither with an intention to plant and reside,
which, if any shall refuse, he is to be retorned or
shipped from thence home." This order may not
have been intended for so great a personage as a
nobleman of the Court. It may have been meant
only to head off humble Irishmen like those who
settled Montserrat, or it may have been merely a
fence against Separatists. But it served the turn
of the alarmed colonists. Pott and Mathews, Claiborne
and Roger Smyth, who led the opposition,
offered the oath to Baltimore. Baltimore had
sacrificed his place in the Privy Council rather
than take this oath so contrary to his conscience,
and he now again stood by his religious convictions,
and took ship for England as ordered by the Virginia
Council. He was disappointed and already
shaken in health. The members of the council, appalled
at their own boldness, perhaps, wrote to the
king in self-defense. There is still extant an old
manuscript record book of the seventeenth century
which contains the instructions to Yeardley. <span class="sidenote">MS. Book of Instructions, Library of Congress, folio
136.</span> Immediately
following, as if to put it under the shelter
of royal authority, is the report of the council,
without date or signature, that the oath had been
offered to Baltimore and refused.</p>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Baltimore's seal.</span> Baltimore's hardships during two voyages to
Newfoundland, and a winter in the rude abodes of
pioneers there, his illness during that winter, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>(p. 233)</span> constant spectacle of sickness and death about him,
and the disappointment caused by his rude reception
in Virginia, were enough, one would think, to
have broken his resolution. He went back to England
"much decayed in his strength," as he confessed;
but, strangely enough, this accomplished
man of the world, whose career had been that of a
courtier, was far from living in ease and quietness
as his friends had expected him to do. He
was possessed of a passion for peopling the wilderness.
He had written to the king from America
that he was resolved to spend "the poore remaynder"
of his days in colony-planting, his "inclinations
carrying him naturally" to such work. To
what extent he was prompted by a desire to leave
to his heir the semi-sovereignty of a principality,
and how far he was carried by a naturally adventurous
temper hitherto latent, we have no
means of deciding; but one can hardly resist the
conclusion that a fervent religious zeal was the
underlying spring of a resolution so indomitable.
Like many another man of that time, Calvert was
lifted from worldliness to high endeavor by religious
enthusiasm. The king felt obliged to interpose
his authority; he forbade Baltimore's
risking his life in another voyage, but he granted
him a charter for a new palatinate on the north
side of the Potomac.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Death of the first Lord Baltimore.</span> Lord Baltimore was doomed never to see the
desire of his eyes. He died on the 15th of April,
1632, before the charter had passed, leaving the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> planting of Maryland to be carried forward by his
son and heir, Cecilius. The charter of Maryland
passed the seals on the 22d of the following June in
favor of Cecilius, the second Lord Baltimore.</p>

<h4>X.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The charter of Maryland.</span> The Maryland charter was no doubt the work
of George Calvert's own hand. Its main provisions
are identical with those of Avalon; but it
put the proprietary in a still better position. He
held Avalon by knight's service, Maryland in free
and common soccage, and the holdings of Maryland
settlers would be under the proprietary, not
under the crown. In fact, the crown retained
practically no rights of value in Maryland beyond
the bare allegiance of the settlers. Larger privileges
of trade were conceded to Maryland than had
been given to Avalon. In one respect the liberties
of the future settlers were apparently better
guarded in the Maryland charter, for there is a
faint promise of a representative government in its
phraseology. But even this was not definitely
assured. In a single regard the charter of Maryland
appears less favorable to the Catholic religion
than its predecessors. Historic specialists
with a religious bias, doing their small best to
render the current of history turbid, have not failed
to convince themselves by means of the new
clause that Maryland was a Protestant colony.
The patronage and advowsons of all churches had
been conferred on the proprietary in the Avalon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>(p. 235)</span> charter, and a like concession is made in the Maryland
grant; but to this, in the Maryland charter, is
attached a sort of "lean-to"&mdash;a qualifying clause
that appears to limit the ecclesiastical organization
of the colony to Anglican forms. "Together with
license and power," runs the charter, "to build and
found Churches, Chapels and Oratories in convenient
and fit places within the premises, and to cause
them to be dedicated and consecrated according to
the ecclesiastical laws of our kingdom of England."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_10" name="note_b3_c1_10"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_10">Note 10.</a></span>
In 1632 the Baltimore family was openly Catholic.
The Puritans were raging against every indulgence
shown by the court to Romanists. The clamor of
the Catholic-baiters did not stop with a demand
that Romanists should be expelled from England. <span class="sidenote">Rushworth, Part I, vol. i, 141, 1623.</span>
The Commons had a few years earlier petitioned
the King that they be excluded from "all other
Your Highness's dominions." The founding of an
English colony that might make a home for English
and Irish Romanists was a more difficult project
in the reign of Charles than it had been in the
time of James when Avalon was granted. The
clause which allowed Baltimore to dedicate his
churches according to the ecclesiastical laws of
England excites admiration.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_11" name="note_b3_c1_11"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_11">Note 11.</a></span> It graciously permitted
an Anglican establishment in Maryland; it did
not oblige Baltimore to do anything at all, nor
did it, in fact, put any constraint whatever on his
actions in this regard. The impotent clause which
seemed to limit, but did not limit, the ecclesiastical
organization was breathlessly followed by one far
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>(p. 236)</span> from impotent&mdash;a masterpiece of George Calvert's
skill. It gave to the proprietary the legal power
exercised from ancient times by the Bishops of
Durham as counts-palatine. The regalities of Durham
having been pared down by Henry VIII, the
charter somewhat furtively reached back after the
local absolutism of the middle ages by giving Baltimore
all the temporal power ever possessed by
any Bishop of Durham. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_12" name="note_b3_c1_12"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_12">Note 12.</a></span> But if alarm should be
taken at the giving of powers so vast to a Roman
Catholic subject, there might be reassurance for
timid souls in a clause in imitation of older charters
than Calvert's, which stipulated that no interpretation
should be put upon the charter by which
God's holy and true Christian religion might be
prejudiced. Ambiguity spread from the charter
to some of the early Maryland laws, which wore
a Protestant or a Catholic face according to the
side from which they were approached.</p>

<h4>XI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Condition of English Catholics.</span> When George Calvert projected his new southern
colony he had every reason to suppose that it
would be quickly supplied with settlers from the
discontented English and Irish Catholics. The
statute enacted in the third year of James, soon
after the Gunpowder Plot, put those who adhered
to the Roman communion in a precarious and
exasperating situation. For the first year that a
Catholic wholly neglected the sacraments of the
English church he must pay twenty pounds. This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span> was raised to forty the second year, and to sixty
for every year of conscientious abstention thereafter. <span class="sidenote">An act for the better discovering and repressing of
popish recusants. Also, An act to prevent, etc., 3 Jac. I, chaps.
iv and v.</span>
If he did not attend the parish church at all,
the luxury of a conscience cost him twenty pounds
a month, which, as money then went, was a large
sum. If he were a rich landholder, the king might
take the use or rentals of two thirds of his land
until he should conform. The oath of allegiance
by which he was to be tested was made ingeniously
offensive to a Catholic conscience. If a Romanist
should persuade a Protestant to accept his own
faith he was guilty of treason, as was also his convert.
The man who harbored a Roman Catholic
neglecting to attend the parish church was to be
fined ten pounds a month. Marriage by a Romish
priest invalidated accruing land tenures. The
Catholic was not suffered to send his children beyond
seas for an education, nor yet to keep a
schoolmaster of his own faith; he could not serve
as an executor; he might not have the charge of
any child; his house might be searched for Catholic
books; he was not allowed to keep weapons; and
when at last his vexed and troubled life was over,
his dead body might not be buried among the
graves of his forefathers in the parish churchyard.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Administration of the law.</span> The administration of this law was attended by
many aggravations. The pursuivants took the
very cattle and household goods of the poor; from
the rich they exacted large payments, failing
which, they pounced on valuable plate and jewels,
which they seized under pretense that these were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> articles of superstition or the concealed property
of Jesuits. <span class="sidenote">Lingard, viii, 189, cites Rymer, xxii, 13; Hardwicke
Papers, 1446, and a private letter.</span> It is said that James derived a revenue
of thirty-six thousand pounds a year from the fines
of lay Catholics. To the several Scotch favorites of
the king were assigned certain rich recusants from
whom they might squeeze whatever could be got
by the leverage of the law.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Influence of foreign policy.</span> Very embarrassing to the foreign policy of
England was the severity of English laws against
Catholics, and Lord Treasurer Burleigh found it
needful to publish in Elizabeth's time, for circulation
in all the courts of Europe, a treatise on The
Execution of Justice in England and the Maintenance
of Public Order and Christian Peace; and
in the following reign James himself turned pamphleteer
and published an Apologie for the Oath
of Allegiance. <span class="sidenote">1583, reprinted 1688.</span>
<span class="sidenote">1609, sm. 4to, pp. 112.</span> There were periods when pressure
from abroad softened the administration of the law.
But it was only irregularly and intermittently that
the Government could be brought to grant indulgences
that roused the pious wrath of Puritans
and reduced the revenue of the king and his
favorites. If Spain, and afterward France, made it
a condition precedent to a marriage treaty that the
penal laws against English recusants should be relaxed,
Parliament, resenting foreign dictation, demanded
of the king a renewal of the severities
against papists. <span class="sidenote">Ellis Collection, first series, iii, 128.</span> Twenty-four Catholics suffered
capitally in James's reign, before 1618; and when
in 1622 it was necessary to condone Catholicism in
order to conciliate Spain, it is said that four hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span> Jesuits and priests were set free on bail at one
time. <span class="sidenote">Neal, ii, ch. ii. Rapin, 215, 2d ed.</span> The number of Catholics, lay and cleric,
released in this year is put at four thousand, but
this may be an exaggeration.</p>

<h4>XII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Catholic emigration small.</span> In 1627, and again in 1628, Lord Baltimore took
Catholics with him to Newfoundland and settled
priests there. The English court was just then
sailing on a Protestant tack, and England had allied
itself with the Huguenots of La Rochelle. Another
of the good works by which the government
of Charles and Buckingham was endeavoring to
prove its sanctification was the enforcement of the
penal statutes against Roman Catholics. It is
notable that Baltimore sailed with the first Catholic
emigrants to Avalon about the time of the setting
in of the movement toward Massachusetts which
swelled at length into the great Puritan exodus.
The five years of delay caused by the change from
Avalon to Maryland, and also perhaps by the exhaustion
of Baltimore's resources and his death,
was unfavorable to the project of a Catholic province.
The English government by 1634 had grown
more lenient toward Romanists, the co-religionists
of the queen. The work at which Laud kept
all hands busy just then was the suppression of
Puritanism, and thousands of Puritans were by this
time shaking the dust of England from their feet
and seeking a home in the western wilderness,
persuaded that the Church of England under Laud
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> had all sails set for Rome. <span class="sidenote">Harl. Miscell., ii, 492, and following, where passages
from contemporary writers are quoted.</span> This illusion regarding
the purposes of the archbishop and his party,
which alarmed the Puritans, heartened the Catholics,
who naturally preferred to stay at home where
a flood tide seemed to be setting toward Catholicism.
The small Catholic migration to Maryland
was not to be compared with that stream of Puritan
emigration that about this time poured into
New England twenty thousand people in a decade.
The fall of Laud and the rise of the Puritans to
power put a complete stop to the New England
migration, but it failed to quicken the Catholic
movement, for Maryland herself had become sadly
involved in the civil commotions of the time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Baltimore's partners.</span> Cecilius Calvert undoubtedly counted on a
large migration of Catholic recusants, and the
documents show that the Jesuit order in England
took great interest in the movement. The second
Lord Baltimore was joined by partners in the
financial risks of the venture, and though we meet
with more than one allusion to these adventurers
whose interest in the colony was apparently still
active twenty years after its beginning, they were
profoundly silent partners; their names are nowhere
recorded, and we are left to conjecture the
origin of their interest in Maryland.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_13" name="note_b3_c1_13"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_13">Note 13.</a></span></p>

<h4>XIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The religious aim.</span> "The first and most important design of the
Most Illustrious Baron, which ought also to be the
aim of the rest, who go in the same ship, is, not to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>(p. 241)</span> think so much of planting fruits and trees in a land
so fertile, as of sowing the seeds of religion and
piety." This was Lord Baltimore's authoritative
declaration, and because it varies in form from the
stock phrases so common at the time, it bears an
air of some sincerity, though it is diplomatically
ambiguous.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Efforts to obstruct the ships.</span> Baltimore's opponents made great exertions
to prevent the departure of the Ark and the
Dove, which were to bear faithful Catholics
across the flood to a new world. A story was
started that these ships were carrying nuns to
Spain, and another tale that found believers was
that they had soldiers on board going to France to
serve against the English. It was told that Calvert's
men had abused the customs officers at
Gravesend, and sailed without cockets in contempt
of all authority, the people on board refusing the
oath of allegiance. The Ark was stopped and
brought back by order of the Privy Council, and
the oath of allegiance was given to a hundred and
twenty-eight passengers. <span class="sidenote">Letters of Baltimore to Wentworth in Strafford papers,
<i>passim</i>.</span> But the ships came to
again at the Isle of Wight, and when they got
away at last there were near three hundred passengers
on board, including Jesuit priests. Most of
the passengers were "laboring men"; how many
were Catholic and how many Protestant it is impossible
now to tell. That the leaders and the
gentry were, most of them, Catholics there is
every reason to believe. The passengers called
Protestants were rather non-Catholics, precisely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> the kind of emigrants that would give the Jesuits
the converts of which they tell exultantly in their
letters. There was no Protestant minister on
board, nor was there the slightest provision for
Protestant worship, present or future.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_14" name="note_b3_c1_14"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_14">Note 14.</a></span></p>

<h4>XIV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Toleration.</span> Toleration was the Baltimore policy from the
beginning. It was no doubt in the original plan of
George Calvert and his associates, whoever they
were. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_15" name="note_b3_c1_15"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_15">Note 15.</a></span> The Provincial of the Society of Jesus privately
furnished Baltimore with arguments in defense
of this policy before the first colony sailed.
The founders of Maryland were men of affairs
shaping plan to opportunity, and the situation was
inexorable. Toleration and protection was all that
English Roman Catholics could hope to find in
traveling thus to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Toleration a policy.</span> Cecilius gave positive instruction that on shipboard
acts of the Roman Catholic religion should
be performed with as much privacy as possible, so
as not to offend the Protestant passengers "whereby
any just complaint may hereafter be made by
them in Virginia or in England." There is no pretense
of theory here; all is based on the exigency
of the situation and sound policy. The policy was
George Calvert's, whose school was the court of
James, and whose whole career shows that he entertained
no advanced views of human liberty.
Had he held toleration as a theory of government,
his doctrine would have been more liberal than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>(p. 243)</span> that of Ralegh and Bacon and far in advance of
that of contemporary Puritan leaders. They quite
misunderstand the man who regard him as a progressive
thinker; he was a conservative opportunist.
Still less was Cecilius a man likely to act
on general principles.</p>

<h4>XV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Religious observance at sea.</span> We have seen how religiously the Puritans
passed their time at sea in long daily expositions of
Scripture and other devotions, and that sometimes
even the watch was set with a psalm. Not less religious
were the Catholic pilgrims, and though the
form is strikingly different, the believing and zealous
age is the same. To make things safe, the
Jesuit fathers committed the principal parts of
the ship in some detail to the protection of God
in the first place, and then to that "of His Most
Holy Mother and of St. Ignatius and of all the
angels of Maryland." <span class="sidenote">Relatio Itineris, p. 10.</span> These angels to whom the
safety of Maryland was committed were kept busy
by special spiritual opponents. A dangerous storm
was raised on one occasion by all the "malignant
spirits of the tempest and all the evil genii of
Maryland." <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_16" name="note_b3_c1_16"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_16">Note 16.</a></span> But Father White circumvented this
combination of ordinary storm spirits with imps of
Protestant proclivities by setting forth to Christ
and the Blessed Virgin, while the storm was at its
worst, "that the purpose of this journey was to
glorify the Blood of our Redeemer in the salvation
of the Barbarians, and also to build up a kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span> for the Saviour and to consecrate another
gift to the Immaculate Virgin his mother." <span class="sidenote">Relatio Itineris, 16, 17.</span> The
last clause apparently refers to Maryland, as if it
were named in honor of the Virgin. The representation
was effective; the good father had scarcely
ceased speaking when the storm began to abate.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">The arrival.</span> The Puritans when using a geographical name
that began with the word "saint" scrupulously uncanonized
it by leaving off the prefix. But these
devout pilgrims of the Roman faith, when once the
saints and guardian angels of Maryland had piloted
them safe in spite of the malice of storm spirits
and evil genii into landlocked waters and the
bounds of Lord Baltimore's grant, proceeded to
sanctify the whole region by sprinkling it with the
names of saints and angels from Michael the archangel
downward. The ancient Indian designations
were marks of a heathenism they purposed to overthrow,
and they began by trying to get rid of the
whole "bead roll of unbaptized names." No convenient
island, creek, river, bay, or cape escaped
Christian baptism. On Annunciation Day, 1634,
they landed on Heron Island, in the Potomac, which
they named appropriately for St. Clement, who was
martyred by being thrown into the sea attached to
an anchor, and here the sacrifice of the mass was
celebrated, the worshipers reflecting that "never
before had this been done in this part of the world."
After the mass they took upon their shoulders a
great cross hewn out of a tree and advanced in
order to the place appointed, where the governor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>(p. 245)</span> and his assistants took part in its erection. The
Catholics of the party, seeing this symbol of the
faith erected in a new land, knelt upon the ground
and recited the litanies of the cross in a kind of religious
ecstasy. Here in another form was that
tender attachment to their faith that one finds
among the more devout Protestant exiles, and in
the nobler natures there was doubtless that element
of the heroic and the saintly often evolved in the
religious sufferings and activities of that day&mdash;a relief
to the pettiness of the debates and the irksomeness
of the bigotries of the age.</p>

<h4>XVI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">A Catholic colony.</span> The colony had been named Maryland by King
Charles in honor of his wife Henrietta Maria; at
least there was assigned to the king responsibility
for a name that, like nearly everything else about
Maryland, was ambiguous. But the phrase <i>Terra
Mariæ</i> in the charter, though represented there to
be the equivalent of Maryland, was significant to a
devout Catholic of something better than a compliment
to a Catholic queen. <span class="sidenote">Compare Clarke's Gladstone and Maryland Toleration.</span> The Indian village
which with its gardens and cornfields had been
bought for the germinal settlement and capital,
took the name of St. Mary's, and the whole infant
colony is called the Colony of St. Maries, by
its own Legislative Assembly in 1638, as though by
Maryland were intended the land of Mary. <span class="sidenote">Maryland Archives, i, 23.</span> Notwithstanding
the manifest care of the second Lord
Baltimore to hold the missionaries within the limits
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> of worldly prudence, the zealous fathers lived and
labored in a spirit of other-worldliness. They
set themselves first of all to convert those sheep
without a shepherd, the Protestants of Maryland.
Some of these appear to have been men of reckless
and immoral lives, who were greatly bettered by
an acceptance of religious restraint. Those non-Catholics
who were ill, and those who found themselves
languishing and dying in the wilderness
without the consolations of their own religion,
were zealously visited and converted <i>in extremis</i> by
the Jesuits. The servants and mechanics employed
by or apprenticed to the missionaries were brought
under their constant influence and were readily
won. Nearly all the Protestants who arrived in
1638 were swiftly brought over to the faith of the
missionaries, and twelve converts were joyously
reckoned as fruits of the Jesuit labors in 1639.
There was more than one instance of the miraculous,
or at least of the marvelous, to help on this
work. One man of noble birth, who had by dissipation
brought himself to desperate straits, and
then sunk until he became at length a bond servant
in Maryland, embraced Catholicism. After the
death of this convert a very bright light was sometimes
seen burning about his place of burial, and
even those who were not Catholics were permitted
to see this wonder. <span class="sidenote">Excerpta de Diversis Literis, etc., 56-60.</span> The horrible punishments that
resulted from the Divine wrath against those who
scoffingly rejected the Catholic faith in Maryland
remind one of the equal calamities that befell those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span> who were unfaithful to Puritanism in New England.
Seventeenth-century Englishmen with sky-wide
differences in opinion were one in the traits
that belonged to their age. Father White was sure
that the destruction of Indians in Maryland was
specially ordered by God to provide an opening
"for His own everlasting law and light"; but not
more sure than were the Puritans that the cruel
plague which exterminated whole villages on the
Massachusetts coast was sent to open a way for the
planting of Calvinistic churches. Each division
of Christians in turn reduced the Almighty Creator
to the level of a special tutelary divinity, sometimes
to that of a rather vindictive genius of the
place.</p>

<p>In this work of propagandism the missionaries
did not forget the red men. Their labors among
the aborigines were fairly successful at first, then
interrupted by relapse and by war. Such is
the history of Indian missions. Much was made
of the solemn profession and baptism of an Indian
"king," at which the governor and other
distinguished men "honored by their presence the
Christian sacraments," the governor marching behind
the neophyte in the procession. Maryland
was in fact openly a Catholic colony until after
1640. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_17" name="note_b3_c1_17"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_17">Note 17.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Failure to make a Catholic state.</span> But as a Catholic colony it was a failure. In
fear of the rising Puritan tempest in England, or
the violent opposition on several grounds of its
stronger neighbor Virginia, and of the mutinous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span> bigotry of its own Puritan settlers, who regarded
Baltimore's government as a "Babylon" to be
overthrown, it was never able to afford to Catholics
perfect security, much less was it able to
promise them domination. But the Catholics included
most of the rich and influential families, and
it was a Jesuit boast that they were superior to
other American settlers in breeding and urbanity.
As they had choice of the best land in the province,
the Catholic families remained during the whole
colonial period among the most prominent people
of Maryland. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_18" name="note_b3_c1_18"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_18">Note 18.</a></span> There is also evidence that the
Catholics were numerically considerable in proportion
to the population, though the reports on the
subject are vague and conflicting. In 1641 they
were about one fourth of the whole. The ranks of
the early Catholic settlers, both of the rich and
poor, seem to have been recruited from Ireland
as well as from England, but the Maryland government
in Queen Anne's Protestant time passed
acts levying an import tax of twenty pounds on
each Irish Catholic servant, in order that the bond
servants and even the transported convicts in
Maryland should be orthodox Protestants.

<h4>XVII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Opposition to Maryland.</span> George Calvert, the first Baron Baltimore,
molded the Maryland enterprise until the drafting
of the charter, and his spirit was felt in it after his
death. Cecilius, his son, was a man of a somewhat
different sort, and his traits became more apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>(p. 249)</span> as time went on. He was strongly supported at
court by Strafford, his father's most devoted and
obliged friend, and no doubt also by the queen,
who was godmother to Maryland. The opposition
to Maryland was probably embittered by the
hatred to Strafford and the jealousy of a Catholic
queen.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The second Lord Baltimore and Virginia.</span> On his enemies in Virginia the younger Baltimore
took ample vengeance. He got one of the
queen's household appointed treasurer of the
colony, and the Virginians found themselves
obliged to pay the quitrents, which had been
neglected and apparently forgotten.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_20" name="note_b3_c1_20"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_20">Note 20.</a></span> Other officers
of the colony were nominated by Baltimore. Harvey,
the governor, hoping to collect money due
him from the royal treasury by Baltimore's assistance,
was his obsequious tool, to the bitter indignation
of the Virginians, who hated Baltimore not
only because he was a Romanist, but also because
he had divided the first colony and cut off the
northern Indian trade from Virginia. In consequence
of the quarrel between Harvey and the
Virginians over Maryland there ensued a revolution
in Virginia; Harvey was shipped to England
by the same bold men who had sent the first Lord
Baltimore packing. But Harvey was sent back
again by the king, and by this counter revolution
the colonial constitution of Virginia was modified
for the worse. It was altogether an exquisite revenge.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Baltimore seeks to control Virginia.</span> Cecilius meditated even a bolder stroke. He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span> schemed through Windebank to have himself made
governor of Virginia, promising to wring out of it
eight thousand pounds more of revenue for the
king from some neglected sources. To achieve
this, he proposed a scheme by which Windebank
was to impose on the king's credulity. Secretary
Windebank may have recoiled from the part he
was to play; it is certain that Charles was not
persuaded to hand over Virginia bound hand and
foot into the power of the proprietary of the rival
colony. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_21" name="note_b3_c1_21"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_21">Note 21.</a></span></p>

<h4>XVIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cautious policy of Baltimore.</span> Intolerance on the part of the authorities of
Maryland directed toward Protestants might have
brought a swift overthrow of the whole project.
The instructions given for the first voyage already
cited show throughout the need for extreme caution
in the face of extreme peril. It is required of
the governor and commissioners that "they be
very careful to preserve the peace amongst all the
passengers on shipboard, and that they suffer no
scandal nor offense to be given to any of the Protestants." <span class="sidenote">Baltimore's instructions, 15 Nov., 1633, Calvert
Papers.</span>
The rulers are to instruct the Catholics
to be silent "upon all occasions of discourse concerning
matter of religion," and those in authority
are to "treat the Protestants with as much mildness
and favor as justice will permit." These instructions
were to hold good after landing, and
in one notable case of religious dissension after
the arrival in Maryland, justice was meted out
against the Catholic offender in a way that showed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span> a disposition to observe this policy of conciliation
toward Protestants at the expense of some unfairness
toward Catholics. Very early a proclamation
was issued for the suppression of all religious disputes,
and Copley, the business administrator of
the Jesuits, thought they ought to be put down for
fear the writings should be sent to the governor
of Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Necessary ambiguity.</span> The ambiguous charter of Maryland was a
necessary hypocrisy. The plan of toleration was
also inevitable, and it was carried no further than
necessity required, for in that age, when toleration
was odious, a liberal policy had also its perils.
The Act for Church Liberties of 1639 was a fine
example of the studied ambidexterity of the Maryland
government. It was enacted "that Holy
Church within this province shall have all her
rights, liberties, and immunities, safe, whole, and
inviolate in all things." Holy Church here is a
deliberate substitution for "the Church of England"
in a similar phrase of Magna Charta. Such
an act was worthy of Bunyan's Mr. Facing-both-ways.
Interpreted by judges holding office at the
will of a Catholic proprietary, it could have but
one meaning. For the outside world it might
bear another sense. It did all that could be done
in the circumstances for the Roman Catholic religion
and for Catholic ecclesiastics. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_22" name="note_b3_c1_22"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_22">Note 22.</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span> XIX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Puritan settlers invited.</span> In 1643, Parliament, dominated by Puritans,
could not let the distant Maryland province rest in
peace. It passed an ordinance making the Earl of
Warwick Governor in Chief and Lord High Admiral
of all the plantations in America. This act
contained covert allusions to papists, Spaniards,
and governors recently appointed by the king. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_23" name="note_b3_c1_23"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_23">Note 23.</a></span>
Baltimore met the rising tempest in a way characteristic
of him. If he could settle a portion of
his province with Puritans they might serve to
shield him from the storm. Besides, the Catholic
emigration had not proved large, and his province
needed inhabitants. He wrote to a Captain Gibbons,
of Boston, sending him a commission under
the Maryland government, and offering "free liberty
of religion and all other privileges" to such
of the New England people as were willing to remove
to Maryland. <span class="sidenote">Winthrop's Journal, ii, 148, 149.</span> There were those in New
England in that day who longed for a more genial
climate, but to settle under the authority of a papist
was to them much like pitching a tent on the
confines of perdition.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Puritans from Virginia.</span> Though Puritans could not be induced to move
from New England, it happened that the Puritans
living in Virginia were persecuted in this same
year by that stanch cavalier and retrograde churchman,
Sir William Berkeley, who wanted his parsons
to read prayers, but did not like preaching
ministers of any sort. <span class="sidenote">1643.</span> He was new to his government,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> and had brought over with him plenty of
hostility to the party that had affronted his royal
master in England. Virginia Puritans had no
choice but to suffer or depart, and Maryland was
convenient. They began soon after this to seek a
refuge under the protection of a proprietary who
was a papist and who practiced toleration&mdash;two
things almost equally hateful to the Puritans. Mr.
James, a Puritan minister, tarried in Maryland a
short time, as early as 1643; he was probably the
only Protestant minister that set foot on Maryland
soil before 1650. But the Puritan was never easy
unless he was uneasy, and he was sure to be uneasy
within when there was none to molest from
without. To take an oath of fidelity to a papist
was to him swearing fealty to antichrist; but so
desirous was Baltimore of Puritan settlers that
even the Maryland oath of fidelity was modified,
and a saving clause was inserted for the ease of
the Puritan conscience. The coming of Puritans
who were in sympathy with the Parliament in
England and who abhorred a tolerant papist, contributed
something to the multifarious turmoils of
the following years.</p>

<h4>XX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Maryland turmoils.</span> What we know of the petty civil wars of Maryland
is tedious and perplexing. The broils before
1649 sprang from diverse sources, some of which
we know, others we may easily conjecture. There
was the old claim of Claiborne to jurisdiction over
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span> Kent Island; there was a disposition on the part
of some of the Marylanders to relieve the tedium
of existence by taking a hand in the great struggle
against royal authority which was rending England;
there was the tendency common in frontier
communities to carry debates to a violent issue;
there was perhaps a natural proneness to insurrection
on the part of bond servants and men lately
out of service; and there was an innate hunger for
spoil of any sort in the seamen of that age and in
the rougher class on shore.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_24" name="note_b3_c1_24"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_24">Note 24.</a></span> But by 1648 the tempest
had passed for the time; order had been reestablished;
the Catholic and the Puritan were living
in peace like the lion and the lamb of Hebrew
prophecy; and the Catholic proprietary, always
promptly bending before the storm, had delegated
his authority to a Protestant governor who took
the Parliament side.</p>

<h4>XXI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Act of 1649.</span> Before this epoch Maryland toleration had been
merely a practical fact. It had not been theoretically
stated; it had not been a matter of legislation
at all; its extent and limitations were unknown.
But now that this colonial home of Catholics was
to be a land of Protestants, and particularly of
Puritans, it was necessary to formulate the principle
of toleration, the more, that Baltimore's own
co-religionists were to be put under a Protestant
governor. Governor and high officers of state
were required to swear that they would molest on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> account of religion no person professing to believe
in Jesus Christ, "and in particular no Roman Catholic."
By the mere march of events it had come
to pass that in the state founded by Catholics as a
cradle for the Roman Catholic religion, the Catholic
was now compelled to secure as best he could
the toleration of his religion at the hands of the
heretic. Part of Baltimore's plan for this new settlement
of affairs involved the sending over of a
code of perpetual laws to be adopted by the Assembly.
The proprietary gave orders that the governor
should not assent to any of these laws if all
were not passed; but the Assembly of Maryland
farmers was too cunning to be entrapped into passing
laws which it thought inconvenient and unjust.
A humble letter was sent from the members to
the lord proprietary complaining that they were
"illeterate" and "void of that Understanding
and Comprehension" necessary to the discussion
of such a code, and that in April they were too
busy with their "necessary employment in a
Crop" to give attention to it. They selected
certain acts out of the code which they passed,
among which was the famous Act of Toleration of
1649. That this was part of the code sent from
England there can be no doubt; the "illeterate"
colonists were not capable of framing it, and it
bears the character-mark of the Baltimore policy
throughout. Here is no philosophic theory of toleration,
no far-reaching conclusion like that of
Roger Williams, that the magistrate may not take
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>(p. 256)</span> cognizance of merely religious offences. Williams
was a thinker, a doctrinary, too far in advance of
his age to be the successful organizer of a new
state. Baltimore, on the other hand, accepted a
practical toleration as an expedient&mdash;he may even
have come to believe in it as a theory by force of
his own situation. But he was not primarily a
thinker at all. Even here, where Baltimorean toleration
reaches high tide, no philosophic congruity
is sought. The Jew and the Unitarian who deny
the divinity of Christ are to be put to death.
Only so much toleration is granted as is needful
to the occasion. And even this toleration is not
put upon any other ground than public policy;
the forcing of conscience in religion "hath frequently
fallen out to be of dangerous consequence";
therefore this law is made "to preserve
mutual love and amity amongst the inhabitants."
The provisions against such offences as blasphemy
and Sabbath-breaking and religious disputes precede
those for toleration. Very politic is the arrangement
by which reviling of God is made a
capital offence, while reviling the Virgin Mary is
adroitly associated with speeches against the "holy
apostles or evangelists" as a sort of second-class
blasphemy, a finable offence.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c1_25" name="note_b3_c1_25"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c1_25">Note 25.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Vicissitudes of toleration.</span> And yet it was toleration, and the law was all
the more influential as an example, perhaps, because
it was only practical and quite incongruous.
It was eminently prudent and statesmanlike. That
it was not perpetually effective was the fault not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span> of Baltimore but of the times. Puritan ideas were
rampant. The government of the proprietary was
overthrown; the Jesuits fled to the inhospitable
Virginia, where they lived concealed in a low hut
like a cistern or a tomb, not lamenting their physical
privations so much as the lack of wine which
deprived them of the consolation of the sacrament.
The new government of Maryland, five years after
Baltimore's famous "act concerning Religion,"
passed a new act with the same title&mdash;an act
brusque and curt, a law with its boots and spurs
on. "That none profess and exercise the papist
religion" is its rude forbidding. The tables are
turned; it is no longer the nonresident Jew and
the hypothetical Unitarian who are excepted. But
the wheels rolled swiftly once more, and in three
years Cecilius, absolute lord and proprietary, was
again master of Maryland, and the beneficent act
of 1649 resumed its sway. It protected the Catholic
element, which, though always rich and influential,
came to be in latter colonial times but
about a twelfth of the population. Toleration also
served to make Maryland an early dwelling place
for abounding Quakers and others holding religious
views not relished in colonies less liberal.</p>

was already actuated by religious zeal, remind us that Glastonbury
(by a curious legendary confusion of names) was also
called Avalon, and that in the Christian legend Joseph of Arimathea
began at Glastonbury the planting of the Christian religion
in Britain. See Anderson's Church of England in the Colonies,
second edition, i, 325, 326. This interpretation of Calvert's intention
in naming his colony was early given. British Museum,
Sloane MSS. XXG. 3662, folio 24, date 1670. When Calvert's
first colony was sent out the Scotch settlement in Newfoundland
was of twelve years' standing, while the Bristol colony had
been seated there five years. Calvert's enterprise seems to have
been pushed with more energy and with a more liberal expenditure
than its predecessors. Compare Whitbourne <i>passim</i> with
the statement of Sir William Alexander in his Encouragement

to examine by the kindness of Lord Edmund Fitzmaurice,

intentional ambiguity of the passages in the Maryland
charter that have to do with religion.</p>

of New England by lot, three shares were laid off and no more.
They were at the extreme north of the territory divided the next
year, and were assigned respectively to the Duke of Lenox, the
Earl of Arundel, and Sir George Calvert. A "grand patent"
was then in preparation for a colony on the coast of Maine to be
called Nova Albion. Calendar Colonial Documents, July 24,
1622. It seems probable, from the charter of Avalon, that Calvert
intended it to be a colony that should harbor Catholics, but
on the other hand the first settlers were chiefly Protestants, with
a clergyman of their own faith, and there seem to have been few
Romanists or none in Avalon until the arrival of a company with
the lord proprietary in 1627.</p>

resignation, Worthies, Nuttall's edition, iii, 417, 418, gives probably
the commonly received story, and shows that the religious
motive was popularly accepted as the reason for his leaving
office. Archbishop Abbot was better informed though less
impartial. His letter is in the curious work entitled "The
Negotiations of Sir Thomas Roe in his Embassy to the Ottoman
Porte from the Year 1621 to 1628," etc., published in 1740.
Abbot says: "Mr. secretary Calvert hath never looked merily
since the prince his coming out of Spaine: it was thought hee
was muche interested in the Spanishe affaires: a course was
taken to ridde him of all imployments and negotiations. This
made him discontented; and, as the saying is, <i>Desperatio facit
monachum</i>, so hee apparently did turne papist, whiche hee now
professeth, this being the third time that hee hath bene to blame
that way. His Majesty to dismisse him, suffered him to resigne
his Secretaries place to Sir Albertus Moreton, who payed him
three thousand pounds for the same; and the kinge hath made
him baron of Baltimore in Ireland; so hee is withdrawn from vs,
and having bought a ship of 400 tuns, hee is going to New England,
or Newfoundlande, where hee hath a colony." Page 372.
The letters preserved among the state papers are the main
authority, especially those addressed to Sir Dudley Carleton, who
desired to buy Calvert's place. See, <i>passim</i>, the Calendar of

principal motives to settle in Newfoundland may be seen by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span> reader who has patience enough to thread his way through the
jumble of mythology, allegory, political economy of a certain
sort, verse in English and Latin, theology, satire, and an incredible
number of what-nots besides "for the generall and perpetuall
good of Great Britain," found in Vaughan's Golden Fleece, published
in 1626. The nearness of Newfoundland to Ireland and
the comparative cheapness of transportation thither, but especially
the well-established value of its fisheries and the market
they afforded for the produce of the colony, were the most plausible
reasons for settling a colony there. Probably there was a
lurking purpose to turn the shore fishery into a monopoly such
as was contemplated by projectors for the New England coast.
The fact was insisted upon that part of Newfoundland was
"equal in climate," or at least in latitude, to "Little Britain in
France," or Brittany. Then, too, Newfoundland is an island, and
Vaughan at least persuaded himself that "Ilanders should dwel
in Ilands." As some of the apostles were fishermen, "Newfoundland
the grand port of Fishing was alloted to Professors
of the Gospell." Golden Fleece, Part Third, pp. 5 and 6 and

complete. Father White, who was cordially entertained by the
Governor of St. Kitts in 1634, speaks of the people of Montserrat
as "pulsos ab anglis Virginiæ ob fidei Catholicæ professionem."
White's choice of words does not necessarily imply, I
suppose, an actual banishment from Virginia, but at least a refusal
of permission to come. Neither Edwards nor Oldmixon
mention this fact; but as White visited St. Kitts only two years
after the settlement at Montserrat, which was made immediately
from St. Kitts (according to Edwards) and was subject to the
same governor, his information was doubtless correct. There
seems to have been another project to plant Catholics in Virginia
about this time, unless, as is rather probable, we meet
the same plan in another form. Sir Pierce Crosby offered to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> plant ten companies "of the Irish Regiment into a fruitful part
of America not yet inhabited." To make the proposal acceptable,
it was stated, somewhat diplomatically perhaps, that the major
part of the officers and many of the soldiers were Protestants.

following century, gave this decision: "As to the said clause in
the grant of the province of Maryland, I am of opinion the same
doth not give him power to do anything contrary to the ecclesiastical
laws of England." This is as ingeniously ambiguous as
the clause itself. The attorneys-general and solicitors-general
during the eighteenth century set themselves to the task of subordinating
colonial government to parliamentary authority by a
series of opinions in which they make rather than explain law.
In the present instance Northey was more modest than usual, for
he reaches a purely negative and impotent conclusion, which
Neill turns into a positive one in his text. Founders of Maryland,
99. There is a collection of opinions on colonial subjects
rendered by the attorneys and solicitors-general in the first half
of the eighteenth century, in a volume at Landsdowne House
which I have examined. This collection was made, or at least
furnished, for the use of Lord Shelburne. Before Northey's
opinion was given the English Parliament had assumed power to
override some provisions of the Maryland charter, as is pointed
out in Abercromby's Examination, MS. at Landsdowne House,
47. How slowly the Church of England grew in the colony may
be inferred from the statement made in 1677, that four clergymen
have plantations and settled "beings" of their own&mdash;a phrase
sufficiently obscure. Others were sustained by voluntary contributions.

others are joined with me in the Adventure"&mdash;that is, in the financial

writes to Bennet, Governor of Virginia, "We have therefore

quality here who are engaged in great adventures in his interest,"
etc. Thurloe, i, 724. A tradition of this co-operation may have
remained in Maryland a century later, for in 1755 or 1756 there
was presented to the Lord Baltimore of that day, who was a
Protestant, a petition from Roman Catholic residents of Maryland
in which this assertion occurs: "The money and persons of
this persuasion contributed chiefly to the settling and peopling of

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Centrifugal forces in Massachusetts.</span> The centrifugal force of religious differences
acted with disastrous results in Maryland, because
the Catholic party, which had always a controlling
negative there through the proprietary, was
in the minority. The Massachusetts people, on
the other hand, were fairly homogeneous in religious
opinion, and their government was admirably
compacted. In Massachusetts religious sentiment
was a powerful centripetal force. Magistrates
and ministers were nicely poised, and each order
relied upon the other to maintain existing conditions.
If the magistrates were perplexed or were
seriously opposed, the elders were called in to advise
or to lend a powerful ecclesiastical sanction to
the rulers. When any disturbance of church order
was threatened, the magistrates came to the front
and supported the clergy with the sharp smiting
of the secular arm. In the magistracy and in the
ranks of the clergy were men of unusual prudence
and ability. If the little Puritan commonwealth
seemed a frail canoe at first, it was navigated&mdash;considering
its smallness one might rather say it was
paddled&mdash;most expertly. But in Massachusetts, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span> well as in Maryland, religious opinion was the main
source of disturbance. The all-pervading ferment
of the time could not be arrested, and more than
once it produced explosion. Now one and now
another prophet of novelty or prophet of retrogression
arose to be dealt with for religious errors;
there were divergences from the strait path of
Puritanism in the direction of a return to Church
of England usage, divergences in the direction of
extreme Separatism, in the direction of the ever-dreaded
"Anabaptism," in the direction of Arianism,
and of so-called Antinomianism. In the case
of the Antinomians, the new movement was able to
shelter itself under the authority of the younger
Vane, then governor, and for a while under the
apparent sanction of the powerful Cotton. But no
other religious disturbance was ever allowed to
gather head enough to become dangerous to the
peace and unity of the little state. Dislike as we may
the principles on which uniformity was enforced,
we must admire the forehanded statesmanship of
the Massachusetts leaders in strangling religious
disturbances at birth, as Pharaoh's midwives did
infant Hebrews.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Early life of Roger Williams.</span> One of the most formidable of all those who
ventured to assail the compact phalanx presented
by the secular and religious authorities of Massachusetts
was Roger Williams. <span class="sidenote">N. Eng. Hist., Gen. Reg., July, 1889.</span> Williams was the
son of a merchant tailor of London. He manifested
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span> in boyhood that quickness of apprehension
which made him successful in acquiring languages
later in life. Before he was fifteen the precocious
lad was employed in the Star Chamber in taking
notes of sermons and addresses in shorthand, and
his skill excited the surprise and admiration of Sir
Edward Coke. Coke had found time, in the midst
of a tempestuous public career and the arduous
private studies that brought him permanent renown,
to defend the legacy which founded the
new Sutton's Hospital, later known as the Charter-House
School. <span class="sidenote">Indorsement of Mrs. Sadleir on Williams's letter,
transcript, Lenox Library; also in Narragansett Club, Pub. VI.</span> Of this school he was one of the
governors, and he appointed young Roger Williams
to a scholarship there, Williams being the
second pupil that ever gained admission to that
nursery of famous men. His natural inclination
to industry in his studies was quickened by the
example and encouragement of Coke, who was wont
to say that he who would harrow what Roger Williams
had sown must rise early. From the Charter
House Williams went to Pembroke College, Cambridge.
He early manifested sincere piety and a
tendency to go to extremes in his Puritan scruples.
Even in his father's house he had begun to taste
the bitterness of persecution. His eager temper
transformed his convictions into downright passions;
his integrity was an aggressive force, and
there was a precipitation in his decisions and actions
that was trying to his friends.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_1" name="note_b3_c2_1"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_1">Note 1.</a></span> From an early
period he showed a conscience intolerant of prudent
compromises. Puritanism had contrived to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>(p. 269)</span> exist and to grow to formidable strength within
the church by means of such compromises. Hooker
and Cotton, two of the greatest luminaries of that
party and afterward the lights that lightened New
England, one day urged on the impetuous Williams
the propriety of temporarily conforming in the use
of the common prayer. By conceding so much to
the judgment of his revered elders, Williams would
have removed the only obstacle to his advancement,
for preferment was offered to the clever and
exemplary <i>protégé</i> of Coke in the universities, in
the city, in the country, and at court.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_2" name="note_b3_c2_2"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_2">Note 2.</a></span> But neither
interest nor example could sway the impractical
young minister. He took refuge, like other extreme
Puritans, in a private chaplaincy, and refused
all compromise, in order, as he afterward
declared, to keep his "soul undefiled in this
point and not to act with a doubting conscience."
Most men feel bound to obey conscience only
where it clearly commands or forbids; good men
may act on the balance of probabilities where there
is doubt; but this young man would not do anything
concerning which his moral judgment felt
the slightest halting. Here is the key to his whole
career; his strength lay in his aspiration for a soul
undefiled; his weakness, in that he was ever a victim
to the pampered conscience of an ultraist.
Property of some thousands of pounds, that might
have been his had he been willing to make oath in
the form required in chancery, he renounced to
his scruples. It certainly seemed rash in a young
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span> man just setting out in life, with a young wife to
care for, to indulge in such extravagant luxury of
scruple.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Flight of Williams from England.</span> Laud succeeded in hunting the non-conforming
Puritans from their lectureships and chaplaincies.
It became with Williams no longer a question of
refusing preferments on both hands with lavish
self-denial, but of escaping the harsh penalties reserved
for such as he by the Courts of High Commission
and the Star Chamber. There was nothing
left but to betake himself to New England for
safety. <span class="sidenote">Williams's letter to Mrs. Sadleir, as above.</span> He fled hurriedly across country on horseback,
feeling it "as bitter as death" that he dared
not even say farewell to his great patron Sir Edward
Coke, who detested schism.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arrival in New England.</span> Here, as in after life, the supreme hardship he
suffered was not mere exile, but that exile of the
spirit which an affectionate man feels when he is
excommunicate of those he loves. His escape by
sea was probably the more difficult because he was
unwilling to "swallow down" the oath exacted of
those who emigrated. But he succeeded in sailing
with his young wife, and in 1631 this undefiled soul,
this dauntless and troublesome extremist, landed in
New England. He was invited to become one of
the ministers of the Boston church.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_3" name="note_b3_c2_3"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_3">Note 3.</a></span> But Williams
was conscientiously a Separatist, and he refused to
enter into communion with the Boston congregation
because of its position with reference to the
church in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span> This protest by withdrawal of communion was
a fundamental principle of Separatism. It was not,
as it appears on the surface, a manifestation of uncharitableness
toward persons, but a solemn protest
by act in favor of a principle.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_4" name="note_b3_c2_4"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_4">Note 4.</a></span> Never was any
man more forgiving, long-suffering, and charitable
toward opponents than Williams, but never was a
man less inclined to yield a single jot in the direction
of compromise where his convictions were involved,
whatever might be the evils sure to result
from his refusal.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Williams at Salem.</span> Williams repaired first to Salem, the north
pole of Puritanism, where the pioneer church of
Massachusetts had a more Separatist tone than
any other. In the phrase of the time, no other
churches in the world were so "pure" as the New
England churches, and Salem was accounted the
"purest" church in New England. Its surviving
minister, Skelton, and its principal layman, Endecott,
both tended to extreme Congregationalism;
but the General Court of the colony protested
against the selection of Williams to be one of the
ministers of the Salem church. Skelton's Separatist
tendencies, Endecott's impetuous radicalism,
and Salem's jealous rivalry with the younger town
of Boston, were already sources of anxiety to the
rulers. The addition of Williams to these explosive
forces was alarming. Williams's ecclesiastical
ideals were not those which the leaders of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span> colony had devoted their lives and fortunes to establish.
Had this young radical been less conscientious,
less courageous, less engagingly good and
admirable, there would not have been so much
reason to fear him. A letter was written to Endecott
protesting against Williams's ordination, because
he had refused communion with the church
at Boston, and because he denied the power of the
magistrate to enforce duties of the first table&mdash;that
is, duties of religion. <span class="sidenote">Winthrop's Journal, i, 63, 12th April, 1631.</span> Here at the very outset of
his American life we find that Williams had already
embraced the broad principle that involved the
separation of church and state and the most complete
religious freedom, and had characteristically
pushed this principle to its logical result some
centuries in advance of the practice of his age.

The protest of the court prevented his ordination.
He yielded to the opposition and soon after removed
to Plymouth, where the people were Separatists,
modified by the conservative teachings of
John Robinson, somewhat modified also by the
responsibility of founding a new state, and perhaps
by association with Puritans of the neighboring
colony.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Williams at Plymouth.</span> At Plymouth the young idealist "prophesied"
in his turn, but did not take office in the church,
which already had a pastor in Ralph Smith, the
Separatist, who had been suffered to come over in
a Massachusetts ship only on his giving a promise
not to preach in that jurisdiction without leave.
The congregation at Plymouth was poor, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> Roger Williams mainly supported himself by hard
toil "at the hoe and the oar"&mdash;that is, perhaps, in
farming and fishing. His body seems to have been
vigorous, and no physical fatigue abated anything
of his mental activity. The Pilgrims had passed
more than twelve years in Holland, and almost
every adult in Plymouth must have known Dutch.
Those of Roger Williams's own age, who were
children when they migrated to Leyden and men
when they left, probably spoke it as well as they
did their mother tongue. <span class="sidenote">Maverick's Description of New England, 25.</span> The Plymouth people,
indeed, were styled "mungrell Dutch" a quarter
of a century later. It is probable that Williams,
with his usual eagerness to acquire knowledge,
now added Dutch to his stock of languages; it is
certain that he afterward taught Dutch to John
Milton. But he was still more intent on learning
the language of the natives, that he might do them
good. He resolved not to accept office as pastor
or teacher, but to give himself to work among
the Indians. <span class="sidenote">Williams to Winthrop, 1632.</span> Perhaps his tendency to individualism
made this prospect pleasing to him. He may
have begun already to realize in a half-conscious
way that there was scant room in any organization
for such as he. The learning of the Indian language
was an arduous toil in more ways than one.
"God was pleased to give me a painful patient
spirit," wrote Williams long after, "to lodge with
them in their filthy, smoky holes to gain their
tongue." He afterward wrote an excellent treatise
on the dialect of the New England Indians.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Writes against the royal patents.</span> At Plymouth Williams spoke, as he had at
Salem, without restraint from any motive of expediency
or even of propriety. Separatist Plymouth,
whose days of advance were over, was a little disturbed
by his speech. In his own sweet, reckless
way he sometimes sharply rebuked even the revered
Bradford when he thought him at fault.
And in the interest of the aborigines and of justice
Williams laid before Governor Bradford a manuscript
treatise which argued that the king had no
right to give away, as he had assumed to do in his
grants and charters, the lands of the Indians merely
because he was a Christian and they heathen.
That it was right to wrong a man because he was
not orthodox in belief could find no place in the
thoughts of one whose conscience was wholly incapable
of sophistication. Bradford accepted candidly
the rebukes of Williams and loved him for
his "many precious parts." <span class="sidenote">Bradford, 310.</span> But as governor of a
feeble colony he was disturbed by Williams's
course. In spirituality, unselfish fearlessness, and
a bold pushing of Separatist principles to their
ultimate logical results, Roger Williams reminded
the Pilgrims of the amiable pastor of the Separatist
church in Amsterdam whose change step by step
to "Anabaptism," the great bugbear of theology
in that time, had been a tragedy and a scandal to
the Separatists of Leyden. <span class="sidenote">Knowles's Life of Williams, 53.</span> Elder Brewster feared
that Williams would run the same course. Williams
wished to return to Salem, where he might
still devote himself to the neighboring Indians, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span> assist Skelton, now declining in health. Brewster
persuaded the Plymouth church to give him a
letter of dismissal. <span class="sidenote">Williams returns to Salem.</span> The leading Pilgrims felt
bound to send "some caution" to the Salem
church regarding the extreme tendencies of Williams.
On the other hand, some of the Plymouth
people were so captivated by his teachings and
his personal character that they removed with
him. This following of an approved minister was
common among Puritans; an acceptable preacher
was of as much value to a town as good meadows,
broad pastures, and pure water.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The town system.</span> To understand the brief career of Williams at
Salem and its catastrophe, we must recall the
character of colonial life in Massachusetts at the
time. There were already sixteen settlements or
"towns" on the shores of Massachusetts Bay, with
an indefinite stretch of gloomy wilderness for background,
the dwelling place of countless savages
and wild beasts. The population of all the settlements
may have summed up five thousand people&mdash;enough
to have made one prosperous village.
The inhabitants of the various towns of the bay
were from different parts of England; their dress
and dialect were diverse, and their Puritanism was
of various complexions. The town system, at first
a reproduction on new soil of the township field
communes that had subsisted in parts of England
from ages beyond the fountain heads of tradition,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span> gave some play to local peculiarities and prejudices.
There is evidence that the central government
relieved itself from strain by means of this
rural borough system. The ancient town system
in turn appears to have taken on a new youth; it
was perhaps modified and developed by the local
diversity of the people, and it lent to Massachusetts,
at first, something of the elasticity of a federal
government. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_6" name="note_b3_c2_6"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_6">Note 6.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Life in the Massachusetts settlements.</span> This community of scattered communes was
cut off from frequent intercourse with the world,
for the sea was far wider and more to be feared in
that day of small ships and imperfect navigation
than it is now. <span class="sidenote">1630 to 1640.</span> The noise of the English controversies
in which the settlers had once borne a part
reached them at long intervals, like news from another
planet. But most of the time these lonesome
settlements had no interest greater than the petty
news and gossip of little forest hamlets. The visitor
who came afoot along Indian trails, or by
water, paddling in a canoe, to Boston on lecture
day, might bring some news of sickness, accident,
or death. Sometimes the traveling story was exciting,
as that wolves had slaughtered the cattle
at a certain place, while yet cattle were few and
precious. Or still more distressing intelligence
came that the ruling elder of the church at Watertown
had taken the High-church position that
Roman churches were Christian churches, or that
democratic views had been advanced by Eliot of
Roxbury. A new and far-fetched prophetical explanation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span> of a passage in the Book of Canticles,
and a tale of boatmen wrecked in some wintry
tempest, might divide the attention of the people.
Stories of boats capsized, of boatmen cast on islands
where there was neither shelter nor food, of boats
driven far to sea and heard of no more, were staples
of excitement in these half-aquatic towns; and
if the inmates of a doomed boat had been particularly
profane, these events were accounted edifying&mdash;divine
judgments on the ungodly. When the
governor wandered once and lost himself in the
forest, passing the night in a deserted wigwam,
there was a sensation of a half-public character.
That a snake and a mouse had engaged in a battle,
and that the puny mouse had triumphed at last,
was in one budget of traveling news that came to
Boston. To this event an ominous significance
was given by John Wilson, pastor of the Boston
church, maker of anagrams, solemn utterer of
rhyming prophecies which were sometimes fulfilled,
and general theological putterer. Wilson
made the snake represent the devil, according to
all sound precedents; the mouse was the feeble
church in the wilderness, to which God would
give the victory over Satan. Thus enhanced by
an instructive interpretation from the prophet and
seer of the colony, the story no doubt took up its
travels once more, and now with its hopeful exegesis
on its back. The Massachusetts mouse was
an auspicious creature; it is recorded by the governor,
and it was no doubt told along the coast,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span> that one got into a library and committed depredations
on a book of common prayer only, nibbling
every leaf of the liturgy, while it reverently spared
a Greek Testament and a Psalter in the same
covers.</p>

<p>In a petty state with a range of intellectual interests
so narrow, the conflict between Williams
and the General Court took place.</p>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Self-consciousness of the Massachusetts community.</span> It was a community that believed in its own
divine mission. It traced the existence of its settlements
to the very hand of God&mdash;the God who
led Israel out of Egypt. The New England colonists
never forgot that they were a chosen people.
Upon other American settlers&mdash;the Dutch
in New Netherland, the Virginia churchmen, the
newly landed Marylanders, with their admixture
of papists&mdash;they looked with condescension if not
with contempt, accounting them the Egyptians of
the New World. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_7" name="note_b3_c2_7"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_7">Note 7.</a></span> The settlers on the Bay of
Massachusetts were certain that their providential
exodus was one of the capital events in human
history; that it had been predesigned from eternity
to plant here, in a virgin world, the only true
form of church government and to cherish a church
that should be a model to the Old World in turn,
and a kind of foreshadowing of the new heaven
and the new earth. Some dreamed that the second
coming of Christ would take place among the
rocky woodlands of New England. The theocratical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>(p. 279)</span> government was thought to be the one most
pleasing to God, and a solemn obligation was felt
to import into this new theocracy the harsh Oriental
intolerance which had marked that fierce
struggle in which the Jewish tribes finally shook
off image worship.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">John Cotton, 1633.</span> The apostle of theocracy who arrived soon
after Williams's return to Salem was John Cotton,
a Puritan leader in England, in whom devoutness
was combined with extreme discretion, a dominant
will with a diplomatic prudence and a temper never
ruffled. Cotton's ingenious refinements made him
a valuable apologist in an age of polemics, but they
often served to becloud his vision of truth and
right. He was prone to see himself as he posed, in
the character of a protagonist of truth. He gave
wise advice to the Massachusetts Puritans at their
departure from England. When, a few years
later, Laud's penetrating vigilance and relentless
thoroughness made even Cotton's well-balanced
course of mild non-conformity impossible, he fled
from his parish of Boston, in Lincolnshire, to London,
and escaped in 1633 with difficulty to the new
Boston in New England. As John Cotton had
been the shining candle of Puritanism in England,
his arrival in America was hailed with joy, and
from the time of his settlement in the little capital
his was the hand that shaped ecclesiastical institutions
in New England, and he did much also to
mold the yet plastic state.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_8" name="note_b3_c2_8"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_8">Note 8.</a></span> Though he usually
avoided the appearance of personal antagonism,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span> every formidable rival he had left Massachusetts
early. Williams, Hooker, Davenport, and Hugh
Peter all found homes beyond the bounds of the
colony. There can not be two queen bees in one
hive, nor can there well be more than one master
mind in the ecclesiastical order of a petty
theocratic state. It was the paradox of colonial
religious organization that the Episcopal colonies
had parishes almost independent of all supervision,
while the New England Congregationalists were,
from the arrival of Cotton, subject to the dominance
of ministers who virtually attained to the
authority of bishops.</p>

<h4>VII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Salem refractory.</span> Salem, the oldest town of the commonwealth,
was the most ready to pursue an independent
course and it was attached to Williams, whose ability
attracted new settlers and who maintained a
position of independence toward Cotton and the
authorities at Boston. To subdue the refractory
Salem was no doubt one of the secondary purposes
of the proceedings against Williams. There seems
to have been no personal animosity toward Williams
himself; his amiable character and his never-doubted
sincerity were main obstacles to his punishment.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Collision inevitable.</span> The return of Roger Williams to such a place
as Salem was naturally a matter of alarm to the
ministers and magistrates of Massachusetts. Collision
was not a matter of choice on either side.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span> The catastrophe was like one that comes from the
irresistible action of physical forces. In a colony
planted at great cost to maintain one chosen form
of worship and subordinating all the powers of
government to this purpose, a preacher who asserted
the necessity for a complete separation of
religion and government in the interest of soul liberty
had no place. His ideal was higher than the
prevailing one, but that age could not possibly rise
to it.</p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The book against the patent.</span> Williams was yet only a private member of the
church in Salem, but in the illness of the pastor he
"exercised by way of prophecy"&mdash;that is, preached
without holding office. An alarming report was
soon in circulation that he had written a book
against the king's patent, the foundation of the
colonial authority. This treatise, we have said,
was written in Plymouth for the benefit of Governor
Bradford. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_9" name="note_b3_c2_9"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_9">Note 9.</a></span> Like many of the manuscript
books that have come down to us, it appears to
have been a small quarto, and, if it resembled other
books of the sort, it was neatly stitched and perhaps
even bound by its author in the favorite pigskin
of the time. Williams sent his book promptly
to be examined. Some of the "most judicious
ministers much condemned Mr. Williams's error
and presumption," and an order was made that he
"should be convented at the next court." In the
charges no fault was found with the main thesis of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span> the book, that the king could not claim and give
away the lands of the Indians; but it was thought
that there were disloyal reflections cast upon both
James and Charles&mdash;at least those eager to condemn
construed the obscure and "implicative
phrases" of Williams in that sense&mdash;and these supposed
reflections were the subject of the charges.
Williams wrote a submissive letter, and offered his
book, or any part of it, to be burned after the manner
of that time. A month later, when the governor
and council met, the whole aspect of the
affair had changed. Cotton and Wilson, the teacher
and the pastor of the Boston church, certified, after
examination of Williams's quarto, that "they found
the matters not so evil as at first they seemed."
It was decided to let Williams off easily. There
are some things unexplained about the affair; the
eagerness of the "judicious ministers" and court
to condemn without due examination, the failure
even to specify the objectionable passages at last,
and the unwonted docility of Williams&mdash;all leave
one to infer that there was more in this transaction
than appears. Laud and his associates were moving
to have the Massachusetts charter vacated, and
it may have seemed imprudent for the magistrates
to found their authority on a base so liable to disappear.
If the charter had been successfully called
in, Williams's ground of the sufficiency of the
Indian title to lands might have proved useful as a
last resort. Williams asserted, long afterward, that
before his troubles began he had drafted a letter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span> addressed to the king, "not without the approbation
of some of the chiefs of New England," whose consciences
were also "tender on this point before
God." <span class="sidenote">Reply to Cotton, 276, 277.</span> This letter humbly acknowledged "the evil
of that part of the patent which relates" to the gift
of lands. Had the letter been sent to its destination
it would have cut a curious figure among the
worldly-minded state papers of the time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">An abstract principle.</span> It is probable that most of the land of the colony
had been secured from the natives by purchase
or by treaty of some sort; at least the Indians
were content, and the little quarto had at that time
no practical bearing whatever, but that did not
matter to Williams. The more abstract a question
of right and wrong, the more he relished a
discussion of it. It was of a piece with his exquisite
Separatism, a mere standing up in the face
of heaven and earth for an abstract principle. His
purpose was not to right a specific and concrete
wrong, for there had been none, but to assert as a
broad principle of everlasting application that a
Christian king may not dispose of the land owned
by heathens merely because of his Christianity.
Williams was not a judge or a lawgiver; he was
a poet in morals, enamored of perfection, and keeping
his conscience purer than Galahad's.</p>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The alarm.</span> It was in the winter of 1633-'34 that the book
about the patent was called in question. Skelton,
pastor of Salem, died in the following August,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>(p. 284)</span> and the Salem people, in spite of an injunction
from the magistrates, made Williams their teacher
in his stead. <span class="sidenote">1634.</span> The country was now full of alarm
at news from England that the charter was to be
revoked, that a general governor of New England
was to be appointed, and that a force was to be
sent to support his authority. Laud was put at
the head of a commission for the government of
the colonies in April, 1634. There could be no
doubt of the meaning of this measure. For more
than a year the alarm in Massachusetts continued.
The ministers were consulted regarding the lawfulness
of resistance to force. A platform was constructed
on the northeast side of Castle Island, and
a fortified house was proposed to defend the platform.
The trainbands were drilled, muskets,
"bandeleroes" or cartridge belts, and rests were
distributed to the several towns, and pikemen were
required to learn to use the cumbrous musket
of the time. Puritans in England, angry that
Laud, the new archbishop and old persecutor,
should stretch a long arm to America, sent powder
and cannon to their co-religionists, the object of
whose military vigilance could easily be covered
by dangers from the savages, from the French,
or from the Spaniards.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Debates not appeased.</span> But these assiduous preparations, under the
supervision of a military commission which had
"power of life and limb," did not abate in the least
the discussion of questions of doctrine and casuistry.
Refinements of theology were quite as real
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>(p. 285)</span> and substantial to the Puritan mind as trainbands
and fortifications. Sound doctrine and a scrupulous
observance of the "ordinances" conciliated
God; they were indeed more important elements
of public safety than drakes and demi-culverins.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Reform in dress.</span> The General Court of September, 1634, undertook
to provide for the public safety in both respects. <span class="sidenote">Mass. Records, 3d September, 1634.</span>
Along with regulations and provisions of
a military nature, it set out to remove those flagrant
sins that had provoked the divine wrath.
The wearing of silver, gold, and rich laces, girdles,
and hatbands was forbidden; slashed clothes were
also abolished, "other than one slash in each sleeve
and another in the back"; ruffs and beaver hats,
which last were apparently a mark of dudishness,
were not to be allowed. Long hair and other
fashions "prejudicial to the general good" were
done away with in this hour of penitence. <span class="sidenote">Compare Ward's Simple Cobbler, <i>passim</i>.</span> Men
and women might wear out the clothes they had,
except their "immoderate great sleeves, slashed
apparel, immoderate great rayles, long wings,"
which were to go at once without reprieve or
ceremony. The use of tobacco, socially and in
public, or before strangers was made an offense.
If taken secretly or medicinally, the Court did not
take cognizance of it.</p>

<h4>X.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The fast-day sermon.</span> Seeing that the millinery sins recounted in this
act had cried to Heaven, and that, beside the danger
from England, there was the desire of Hooker's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>(p. 286)</span> party to remove to the Connecticut, and a
dissension concerning the power of the Upper
House that threatened trouble, the Court appointed
the 18th of September a solemn fast-day,
hoping by repentance, prayer, and the penance
of hunger to avert the manifold disasters that
threatened them. <span class="sidenote">1634.</span> Roger Williams was sure to
speak like a prophet on such an occasion. He did
not stop at slashed garments, great sleeves, and
headdresses with long wings; he preached on
eleven "public sins" that had provoked divine
wrath. We have no catalogue left us. The list
may have included some of those amusing scruples
that he held in common with other Puritans, or
some of those equally trivial personal scruples that
Williams cherished so fondly. But no sermon of
his on public sins could fail to contain a declaration
of his far-reaching and cherished principle of
religious freedom, including perhaps a round denunciation
of the petty inquisition into private
opinion which had been set up in Massachusetts.
The Sabbath law, the law obliging men to pay a
tax to support religious worship, the requirement
that all should attend religious worship under
penalty, and the enforcement of a religious oath
on irreligious and perhaps unwilling residents, the
assumption of the magistrate to regulate the orthodoxy
of a church under the advice of the ministers,
were points of Massachusetts law and administration
that he denounced at various times; and some
of them, if not all, were no doubt put in pillory in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>(p. 287)</span> this fast-day sermon in the early autumn of 1634.
Judged by modern standards, the sermon may
have had absurdities enough, but it was no doubt
a long way in advance of the General Court's
mewling about lace, and slashes, and long hair, and
other customs "prejudicial to the general good."
To this sermon, whatever it was, Williams afterward
attributed the beginning of the troubles that
led to his banishment.</p>

<h4>XI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Williams dealt with ecclesiastically.</span> Winthrop, just but gentle, narrow-minded but
ever large-hearted, had been superseded in the
governorship by Dudley, open and zealous advocate
of religious intolerance. Dudley, who was
always hot-tempered, was for proceeding out of
hand with the bold "teacher" of the church in
Salem, but he felt bound to consult with the ministers
first, since Williams was an "elder," and even
among Puritans there was a sort of benefit of
clergy. Cotton had developed a complete system
of church-state organization hammered out of, or
at least supported by, Bible texts linked by ingenious
inferences, and from the time of Cotton's
arrival there was a strong effort to secure uniformity.
But Cotton was timid in action, and he
was nothing if not orderly and ecclesiastical. Williams
was an elder, entitled as such to be proceeded
with "in a church way" first. As leader
and spokesman of the clergy Cotton expressed his
charitable conviction that Williams's "violent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>(p. 288)</span> course did rather spring from scruple of conscience
than from a seditious principle." The
clergy proposed to try to convert him by argument,
not so much, perhaps, from hope of success
as from a conviction that this was the orderly and
scriptural rule.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_10" name="note_b3_c2_10"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_10">Note 10.</a></span> Dudley, impatient to snuff out
Williams at once, replied that they "were deceived
in him if they thought he would condescend
to learn of any of them." But the "elders"
now proceeded in the roundabout way prescribed
by Cotton's system ingeniously deduced from
Scripture. The individual church must deal with
its own member; the sister churches might remonstrate
with a church. Cotton and Wilson, for
example, could appeal to the Boston church to appeal
to the Salem church to appeal to Williams,
and in this order much of the correspondence
went on.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The governor's verse.</span> It was, perhaps, when his desire to act promptly
against the Salem heretic was thus foiled by Cotton's
prudent and intricate orderliness in procedure
that Dudley relieved his emotions by what is happily
the only example of his verse that has survived:</p>

<span class="sidenote">Eliot's New England Biography, 156, 157.</span>

<p class="poem10">
Let men of God in courts and churches watch<br>
O'er such as do a toleration hatch,<br>
Lest that ill egg bring forth a cockatrice<br>
To poison all with heresy and vice.<br>
If men be left and otherwise combine,<br>
My epitaph's I die no libertine.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>(p. 289)</span> XII.</h4>

<p>The most substantial grievance of the rulers
against Williams was his opposition to "the oath."
In order to make sure of the loyalty of the residents
in this time of danger a new oath of fidelity
to be taken by residents had been promulgated.
Practical men are wont to put aside minor scruples
in time of danger. David eats the sacred shew-bread
when he is famishing: but Williams would
rather starve than mumble a crumb of it. He did
not believe in enforced oaths; they obliged the
wicked man to a religious act, and thus invaded
the soul's freedom. Cotton says that Williams's
scruples excited such an opposition to the oath
that the magistrates were not able to enforce it.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_11" name="note_b3_c2_11"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_11">Note 11.</a></span>
He thus unwittingly throws a strong light on the
weakness of the age, and extenuates the conduct
of Williams as well as that of the rulers. The age
was in love with scrupulosity, and Williams on this
side was the product of his time. In such an age
a scruple-maker of ability and originality like Williams
might be a source of danger.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Scruples small and great.</span> During the year following Williams was several
times "convented" before the Court. He was
charged with having broken his promise not to
speak about the patent, with opposing the residents'
oath, with maintaining certain scruples in
opposition to the customs of the times, as that a
man should not return thanks after a meal, or call
on an unregenerate child to give thanks for his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>(p. 290)</span> food. These were not more trivial certainly than
half a hundred scruples then prevalent, but they
chanced to be unfashionable&mdash;a damning fault in a
scruple. The sense of proportion was feeble in religionists
of that day, and neither Williams nor his
opponents understood the comparative magnitude
of his greater contentions, and the triviality of
those petty scruples about which, like the whole
Puritan world, he was very busy. Religious freedom
and the obligation of grace after meat could
then be put into the same category. As years
went by, although the mind of Williams was never
disentangled from scrupulosity, he came to see
clearly what was the real battle of his life. No
better fortune can befall a great spirit than such a
clarification of vision. The extended works of
Williams's later life are written mainly to overthrow
the "bloody tenent of persecution." It was
this championship of soul liberty as the weightiest
matter of the law that lifted him above all others
who paid tithes of their little garden herbs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Williams inflexible.</span> Williams was certainly incorrigible. Richard
Brown, the ruling elder of the church at Watertown,
seems to have submitted to the remonstrance
of the magistrates against his too charitable judgment
of the Roman churches. <span class="sidenote">Savage's Winthrop's Journal, i, 81.</span> Eliot, of Roxbury,
afterward the Indian apostle, advanced peculiar
opinions also, but he was overborne and convinced. <span class="sidenote">Mass. Rec., i, 135, 136.</span>
Stoughton, who had denied that the "assistants"
of a corporation were scriptural magistrates, was
brought to book about this time, and he retracted.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>(p. 291)</span> Salem itself was forced to bend its stiff neck at
last. The town had been refused its land on
Marble Neck because of its ordination of Williams,
and having, under Williams's leadership, protested
in a letter to the churches against the injustice of
spiritual coercion by financial robbery, the deputies
of Salem were now summarily turned out of
the court. Endecott, with characteristic violence,
protested further against the double injustice to
Salem. <span class="sidenote">Mass. Rec., i, 156, 157. Winthrop's Journal, i, 194.</span> He was promptly put under arrest, and
this severity brought swift conviction to his mind,
so that he humbly apologized and submitted the
same day. The only bond of unity between the
rash Salem leader and Williams was a common
tendency to go to extremes. In spirit, the heroic,
long-suffering Williams, who rested in what he
called the "rockie strength" of his opinions in
spite of penalties and majorities, was far removed
from a leader who bent before the first blast, and
who became in later life the harshest persecutor
in the commonwealth.</p>

<h4>XIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Williams's trial.</span> Williams remained the one resolute, stubborn,
incorrigible offender. Eliot, Stoughton, and Endecott,
and even Williams's fellow-elder, Sharpe, and
the whole church at Salem, might be argued into
conformity by the sharp dialectics of the clergy, or
bullied out of their convictions by the sharper logic
of the magistrates, but Roger Williams could not
be overborne. Individualist in his very nature, his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span> self-reliant spirit was able to face isolation or excommunication.
The great Hooker was set to dispute
with him. Hooker's refined arguments were
drawn out by inferences linked to inferences. He
proved to the satisfaction of everybody but the
culprit that it was not lawful for Williams, with his
opinions, to set food before his unregenerate child,
since he did not allow an irreligious child to go
through the form of giving thanks. But the wire-drawn
logic of Hooker, though Williams could not
always answer it, had no more influence with him
than the ingenious sophistications of the pious
Cotton; Williams constantly fell back upon the
"rockie strength" of his principles. On the 9th
of October, 1635, he was sentenced to banishment.
After the manner of that curious age, his banishment
was based on charges of great importance
mixed with charges utterly trivial. His denial of
the authority of the magistrate to regulate the
orthodoxy of the churches and the belief of individuals
is, however, made one of the cardinal
offenses in all the trustworthy accounts given at
the time. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_12" name="note_b3_c2_12"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_12">Note 12.</a></span> With this were joined in the proceedings,
but not in the sentence, such things as the
denial of the propriety of grace after meat. All
the elders but one advised his banishment.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Williams banished.</span> The magistrates, though deeply "incensed"
against him, probably felt at the last some reluctance
to banish such a man. Six weeks were accorded
him in which to leave. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_13" name="note_b3_c2_13"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_13">Note 13.</a></span> Winthrop, who
was Williams's friend, and who seems to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293"></a>(p. 293)</span> loath to consent to his banishment, wrote to him to
"steer his course for Narragansett Bay," where
there was territory beyond the bounds of Massachusetts
and Plymouth. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_14" name="note_b3_c2_14"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_14">Note 14.</a></span> The forest journeys or
boat voyages to Boston and back, the bitter controversies
there, and the uproar of indignation
which was produced in Salem by the news of the
verdict, the desertion of Williams by Endecott, convinced
by force, and by Sharpe, the ruling elder,
who had been also dealt with, the natural yielding
of the Salem church after a while to the pressure
from the General Court, and to the desire of the
townsmen to secure the lands at Marble Neck, put
a strain on Williams which, added to his necessary
toil in the field, broke his health and he fell ill.
The General Court probably also felt the recoil of
its act. When six weeks had expired consent
was given that Williams should remain during the
winter provided he would refrain from preaching.
But Williams was in Salem, and in Salem he was
the center of interest&mdash;just now he was the center
of explosion. It was impossible for the great Separatist
to be silent. A few faithful friends, come-outers
like himself, clave to him and repudiated as
he did communion with the church at Salem, which
could condone the offenses of the magistrates for
the sake of "these children's toys of land, meadows,
cattle, and government."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_15" name="note_b3_c2_15"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_15">Note 15.</a></span> These fellow-Separatists,
some of whom perhaps had removed from Plymouth
out of love for this unworldly saint, loved him
none the less for his courage and his sorrows.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>(p. 294)</span> They frequented his house on Sunday as he convalesced.
Indeed, the attachment to him was so
great that the "ordinances" which had been appointed
by the magistrates and enforced on Salem
as the price of the common land on Marble Neck,
were neglected and almost deserted.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_16" name="note_b3_c2_16"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_16">Note 16.</a></span> Williams
could not refrain from speech with this concourse
of visitors, and at length word came to Boston that
more than twenty persons had definitely adhered
to the opinions of their former teacher, unconvinced
by the argument of the rod of justice applied
to Endecott and Sharpe, or by the valuable
land on Marble Neck. These disciples proposed
to remove in the spring with Williams to the shores
of Narragansett Bay. This might meet the approval
of the sagacious and kindly Winthrop, who
had directed Williams's attention to that promising
place, and who foresaw perhaps the usefulness of
such a man in the dangerous Indian crisis now
threatening the colony. But to devotees of uniformity,
the prospect of a community on the very
border of the land of the saints tolerating all sorts
of opinionists was insufferable. When once the
civil government weights itself with spiritual considerations,
its whole equilibrium is disturbed.
Liberty and justice seem insignificant by the side
of the immensities. <span class="sidenote">Savage's Winthrop, i, 209, 210.</span> The magistrates, or a part of
them, were alarmed at the prospect of a settlement
of the followers of Williams at Narragansett Bay,
"whence the infection would easily spread into
these churches, the people being, many of them,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>(p. 295)</span> much taken with an apprehension of his godliness."
It was therefore agreed to send him to England
on a ship soon to sail.</p>

<h4>XIV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Escape to the Indians.</span> The hardships of such a voyage in midwinter
in his state of health might prove fatal, and his
arrival in England would almost certainly deliver
him into the hands of Laud. But what is justice
or mercy when the welfare of churches and the
rescue of imperiled souls is to be considered? A
warrant was dispatched ordering him to Boston
within a certain time. Probably knowing what
was in store for him, he protested that it would be
dangerous for him, in view of his health, to make
the journey, and some of the Salem people went to
Boston in his behalf, and, as was natural in the circumstances,
made exaggerated representations regarding
his physical condition. But the magistrates
had other information. They sent the valiant and
notorious Captain Underhill, in whom were mingled
about equally devoutness, military courage,
and incorrigible lewdness, to bring Williams by
sea in a shallop. Williams was probably informed
of their purpose, for, while Underhill in his little
craft was beating up to Salem in wintry seas on an
errand so congenial, expecting perhaps to come
upon his quarry unawares, Williams was fleeing
from one hamlet of bark wigwams to another.
Here among the barbarians he was sure of faithful
friends and secure concealment. Underhill found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>(p. 296)</span> on his arrival that the culprit had disappeared
three days before he got there, and nobody in
Salem, that could, would tell whither the fugitive
had gone.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Williams founds Providence.</span> Meantime Williams was, to use his own figure
of speech, "steering his course" "in winter snow"
toward Narragansett Bay. "I was sorely tossed
for one fourteen weeks in a bitter winter season,"
he says, in his vivid and hyperbolic fashion of
speech, "not knowing what bed or bread did
mean." He began one settlement on the eastern
bank of the Seekonk River after getting land from
the Indians, but his old enemies the royal patents
now had their revenge. Winslow, governor of
Plymouth, a kind-hearted, politic man, the one born
diplomatist of New England, warned him that he
was within the bounds of Plymouth, and asked
him to remove to the other side of the water, because
they "were loath to displease the Bay." It
was not enough to drive a heretic from the bounds
of Massachusetts; the pragmatic Puritanism of the
time would have expelled him from the continent
had its arm been long enough. Williams had already
begun to build and to plant, but he removed
once more to the place which he named Providence.
He planted the germinal settlement of
the first state in the world that founded religious
liberty on the widest possible basis, reserving to
the law no cognizance whatever of religious beliefs
or conduct where the "civil peace" was not endangered.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>(p. 297)</span> XV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Williams's banishment an act of persecution.</span> Local jealousy and sectarian prejudice have
done what they could to obscure the facts of the
trial and banishment of Williams. It has been argued
by more than one writer that it was not a
case of religious persecution at all, but the exclusion
of a man dangerous to the state. Cotton,
with characteristic verbal legerdemain, says that
Williams was "enlarged" rather than banished.
The case has even been pettifogged in our own
time by the assertion that the banishment was
only the action of a commercial company excluding
an uncongenial person from its territory. But
with what swift indignation would the Massachusetts
rulers of the days of Dudley and Haynes
have repudiated a plea which denied their magistracy!
They put so strong a pressure on Stoughton,
who said that the assistants were not magistrates,
that he made haste to renounce his pride
of authorship and to deliver his booklet to be officially
burned, nor did even this prevent his punishment.
The rulers of "the Bay" were generally
frank advocates of religious intolerance; they regarded
toleration as a door set open for the devil
to enter. Not only did they punish for unorthodox
expressions; they even assumed to inquire into
private beliefs.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_17" name="note_b3_c2_17"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_17">Note 17.</a></span> Williams was only one of scores
bidden to depart on account of opinion.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Intolerance as a virtue.</span> The real and sufficient extenuation for the conduct
of the Massachusetts leaders is found in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>(p. 298)</span> character and standards of the age. A few obscure
and contemned sectaries&mdash;Brownists, Anabaptists,
and despised Familists&mdash;in Holland and
England had spoken more or less clearly in favor
of religious liberty before the rise of Roger Williams,
but nobody of weight or respectable standing
in the whole world had befriended it.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_18" name="note_b3_c2_18"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_18">Note 18.</a></span> All the
great authorities in church and state, Catholic
and Protestant, prelatical and Puritan, agreed in
their detestation of it. Even Robinson, the moderate
pastor of the Leyden Pilgrims, ventured to
hold only to the "toleration of tolerable opinions."
This was the toleration found at Amsterdam and
in some other parts of the Low Countries. Even
this religious sufferance which did not amount to
liberty was sufficiently despicable in the eyes of
that intolerant age to bring upon the Dutch the
contempt of Christendom. It was a very qualified
and limited toleration, and one from which Catholics
and Arminians were excluded. It seems to
have been that practical amelioration of law which
is produced more effectually by commerce than by
learning or religion.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_19" name="note_b3_c2_19"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_19">Note 19.</a></span> Outside of some parts of the
Low Countries, and oddly enough of the Turkish
Empire, all the world worth counting decried toleration
as a great crime. It would have been wonderful
indeed if Massachusetts had been superior
to the age. "I dare aver," says Nathaniel Ward,
the New England lawyer-minister, "that God doth
no where in his word tolerate Christian States to
give tolerations to such adversaries of his Truth, if
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span> they have power in their hands to suppress them." <span class="sidenote">Simple Cobbler of Agawam, pp. 3 and 6.</span>
To set up toleration was "to build a sconce against
the walls of heaven to batter God out of his chair,"
in Ward's opinion.</p>

<h4>XVI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The casuistry of Cotton.</span> This doctrine of intolerance was sanctioned by
many refinements of logic, such as Cotton's delicious
sophistry that if a man refused to be convinced
of the truth, he was sinning against conscience,
and therefore it was not against the liberty
of conscience to coerce him.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_20" name="note_b3_c2_20"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_20">Note 20.</a></span> Cotton's moral intuitions
were fairly suffocated by logic. He declared
that men should be compelled to attend religious
service, because it was "better to be hypocrites
than profane persons. Hypocrites give God part
of his due, the outward man, but the profane
person giveth God neither outward nor inward
man." <span class="sidenote">Hutchinson Papers, 496.</span> To reason thus is to put subtlety into the
<i>cathedra</i> of common sense, to bewilder vision by
legerdemain. Notwithstanding his natural gift for
devoutness and his almost immodest godliness,
Cotton was incapable of high sincerity. He would
not specifically advise Williams's banishment, but
having labored with him round a corner according
to his most approved ecclesiastical formula, he
said, "We have no more to say in his behalf, but
must sit down"; by which expression of passivity
he gave the signal to the "secular arm" to do its
worst, while he washed his hands in innocent self-complacency.
When one scrupulous magistrate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span> consulted him as to his obligation in Williams's
case, Cotton answered his hesitation by saying,
"You know they are so much incensed against his
course that it is not your voice nor the voice of
two or three more that can suspend the sentence."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_21" name="note_b3_c2_21"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_21">Note 21.</a></span>
By such shifty phrases he shirked responsibility
for the results of his own teaching. Of the temper
that stands alone for the right, Nature had given
him not a jot. Williams may be a little too severe,
but he has some truth when he describes Cotton
on this occasion as "swimming with the stream of
outward credit and profit," though nothing was
further from Cotton's conscious purpose than such
worldliness. Cotton's intolerance was not like that
of Dudley and Endecott, the offspring of an austere
temper; it was rather the outgrowth of his
logic and his reverence for authority. <span class="sidenote">Controversie concerning Liberty of Conscience.</span> He sheltered
himself behind the examples of Elizabeth and
James I, and took refuge in the shadow of Calvin,
whose burning of Servetus he cites as an example,
without any recoil of heart or conscience. But the
consideration of the character of the age forbids
us to condemn the conscientious men who put Williams
out of the Massachusetts theocracy as they
would have driven the devil out of the garden of
Eden. <span class="sidenote">Character of Puritanism.</span> When, however, it comes to judging the
age itself, and especially to judging the Puritanism
of the age, these false and harsh ideals are its sufficient
condemnation. Its government and its very
religion were barbarous; its Bible, except for mystical
and ecclesiastical uses, might as well have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>(p. 301)</span> closed with the story of the Hebrew judges and
the imprecatory Psalms. The Apocalypse of John,
grotesquely interpreted, was the one book of the
New Testament that received hearty consideration,
aside from those other New Testament passages
supposed to relate to a divinely appointed
ecclesiasticism. The humane pity of Jesus was unknown
not only to the laws, but to the sermons of
the time. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_22" name="note_b3_c2_22"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_22">Note 22.</a></span> About the time of Williams's banishment
the lenity of John Winthrop was solemnly
rebuked by some of the clergy and rulers as a lax
imperiling of the safety of the gospel; and Winthrop,
overborne by authority, confessed, explained,
apologized, and promised amendment. <span class="sidenote">Savage's Winthrop, i, 211-214.</span>
The Puritans substituted an unformulated belief
in the infallibility of "godly" elders acting with
the magistrates for the ancient doctrine of an infallible
church.</p>

<h4>XVII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Character of Williams. His scruples.</span> In this less scrupulous but more serious age it
is easy to hold Williams up to ridicule. Never
was a noble and sweet-spirited man bedeviled by a
scrupulosity more trivial. <span class="sidenote">New England Firebrand Quenched, 246.</span> Cotton aptly dubbed
him "a haberdasher of small questions." His extant
letters are many of them vibrant with latent
heroism; there is manifest in them an exquisite
charity and a pathetic magnanimity, but in the
midst of it all the writer is unable to rid himself of
a swarm of scruples as pertinacious as the buzzing
mosquitoes in the primitive forest about him. In
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span> dating his letters, where he ventures to date at all,
he never writes the ordinary name of the day of
the week or the name of the month, lest he should
be guilty of etymological heathenism. He often
avoids writing the year, and when he does insert
it he commits himself to the last two figures only
and adds a saving clause. Thus 1652 appears as
"52 (so called)," and other years are tagged with
the same doubting words, or with the Latin "<i>ut
vulgo</i>." What quarrel the tender conscience had
with the Christian era it is hard to guess. So, too,
he writes to Winthrop, who had taken part in his
banishment, letters full of reverential tenderness
and hearty friendship. But his conscience does
not allow him even to seem to hold ecclesiastical
fellowship with the man he honors as a ruler and
loves as a friend. <span class="sidenote">Williams to Winthrop, 1637, Narr. Club, vi.</span> Once at least he guards the point
directly by subscribing himself "Your worship's
faithful and affectionate in all <i>civil</i> bonds." It
would be sad to think of a great spirit so enthralled
by the scrupulosity of his time and his party if
these minute restrictions had been a source of annoyance
to him. But the cheerful observance of
little scruples seems rather to have taken the place
of a recreation in his life; they were to him perhaps
what bric-a-brac is to a collector, what a well-arranged
altar and candlesticks are to a ritualist.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_23" name="note_b3_c2_23"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_23">Note 23.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Williams becomes a Seeker.</span> Two fundamental notions supplied the motive
power of every ecclesiastical agitation of that age.
The notion of a succession of churchly order and
ordinance from the time of the apostles was the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>(p. 303)</span> mainspring of the High-church movement. Apostolic
primitivism was the aim of the Puritan and
still more the goal of the Separatist. One party
rejoiced in a belief that a mysterious apostolic virtue
had trickled down through generations of bishops
and priests to its own age; the other rejoiced
in the destruction of institutions that had grown
up in the ages and in getting back to the primitive
nakedness of the early Christian conventicle.
True to the law of his nature, Roger Williams
pushed this latter principle to its ultimate possibilities.
If we may believe the accounts, he and
his followers at Providence became Baptists that
they might receive the rite of baptism in its most
ancient Oriental form. But in an age when the
fountains of the great deep were utterly broken up
he could find no rest for the soles of his feet. It
was not enough that he should be troubled by
the Puritan spirit of apostolic primitivism; he had
now swung round to where this spirit joined hands
with its twin, the aspiration for apostolic succession.
He renounced his baptism because it was
without apostolic sanction, and announced himself
of that sect which was the last reduction of Separatism.
He became a Seeker. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c2_24" name="note_b3_c2_24"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c2_24">Note 24.</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Seekers.</span> Here again is a probable influence from Holland.
The Seekers had appeared there long before.
Many Baptists had found that their search
for primitivism, if persisted in, carried them to this
negative result; for it seemed not enough to have
apostolic rites in apostolic form unless they were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>(p. 304)</span> sanctioned by the "gifts" of the apostolic time.
The Seekers appeared in England as early as 1617,
and during the religious turmoils of the Commonwealth
period the sect afforded a resting place for
many a weatherbeaten soul. As the miraculous
gifts were lost, the Seekers dared not preach, baptize,
or teach; they merely waited, and in their
mysticism they believed their waiting to be an
"upper room" to which Christ would come. It is
interesting to know that Williams, the most romantic
figure of the whole Puritan movement, at last
found a sort of relief from the austere externalism
and ceaseless dogmatism of his age by traveling
the road of literalism until he had passed out on
the other side into the region of devout and contented
uncertainty.</p>

<h4>XVIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Moral elevation of Williams</span> In all this Williams was the child of his age,
and sometimes more childish than his age. But
there were regions of thought and sentiment in
which he was wholly disentangled from the meshes
of his time, and that not because of intellectual superiority&mdash;for
he had no large philosophical views&mdash;but
by reason of elevation of spirit. Even the authority
of Moses could not prevent him from condemning
the harsh severity of the New England
capital laws. He had no sentimental delusions
about the character of the savages&mdash;he styles them
"wolves endued with men's brains"; but he constantly
pleads for a humane treatment of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>(p. 305)</span> All the bloody precedents of Joshua could not
make him look without repulsion on the slaughter
of women and children in the Pequot war, nor
could he tolerate dismemberment of the dead or
the selling of Indian captives into perpetual slavery.
From bigotry and resentment he was singularly
free. On many occasions he joyfully used his
ascendency over the natives to protect those who
kept in force against him a sentence of perpetual
banishment. And this ultra-Separatist, almost
alone of the men of his time, could use such words
of catholic charity as those in which he speaks of
"the people of God wheresoever scattered about
Babel's banks either in Rome or England."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Superior to the age.</span> Of his incapacity for organization or administration
we shall have to speak hereafter. But his
spiritual intuitions, his moral insight, his genius
for justice, lent a curious modernness to many of
his convictions. In a generation of creed-builders
which detested schism he became an individualist.
Individualist in thought, altruist in spirit, secularist
in governmental theory, he was the herald of a
time yet more modern than this laggard age of
ours. If ever a soul saw a clear-shining inward
light not to be dimmed by prejudices or obscured
by the deft logic of a disputatious age, it was the
soul of Williams. In all the region of petty scrupulosity
the time-spirit had enthralled him; but in
the higher region of moral decision he was utterly
emancipated from it. His conclusions belong to
ages yet to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>(p. 306)</span> <span class="sidenote">His prophetic character.</span> This union of moral aspiration with a certain
disengagedness constitutes what we may call the
prophetic temperament. Bradford and Winthrop
were men of high aspiration, but of another class.
The reach of their spirits was restrained by practical
wisdom, which compelled them to take into
account the limits of the attainable. Not that they
consciously refused to follow their logic to its end,
but that, like other prudent men of affairs, they
were, without their own knowledge or consent,
turned aside by the logic of the impossible. Precisely
here the prophet departs from the reformer.
The prophet recks nothing of impossibility; he is
ravished with truth disembodied. From Elijah the
Tishbite to Socrates, from Socrates to the latest
and perhaps yet unrecognized voice of our own
time, the prophetic temperament has ever shown
an inability to enter into treaty with its environment.
In the seventeenth century there was no
place but the wilderness for such a John Baptist of
the distant future as Roger Williams. He did not
belong among the diplomatic builders of churches,
like Cotton, or the politic founders of states, like
Winthrop. He was but a babbler to his own time,
but the prophetic voice rings clear and far, and
ever clearer as the ages go on.</p>

him as passionate and precipitate, but with integrity and good

knows what gains and preferments I have refused in universities,
city, country and court," etc. Williams's enthusiastic nature
gave a flush of color to his statement of ordinary fact, the general
correctness of which, however, there is never reason to doubt.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b3_c2_3" name="anote_b3_c2_3"></a><a href="#note_b3_c2_3">Note 3, page 270.</a></span> Letter to John Cotton the younger, Narragansett Club Publications,
vi, 356. There is no account of this event elsewhere, but
the church records of that early date are imperfect, and there is
every reason to accept the circumstantial statement of Williams.
That he refused to enter into membership with the church is
confirmed by Winthrop's Journal, 12th April, 1631, and such refusal
must have had some such occasion.</p>

it," were Winthrop's words to Williams, who gave to Massachusetts
lifelong service in return for its lifelong severity toward
him. The sentence is quoted in Williams's letter to the
younger Cotton, cited above, which is itself a fine example of
his magnanimity of spirit. Narragansett Club Publications, vi,

of Williams himself seem to bear on it. After his retirement
from Salem to Plymouth he received a letter from Winthrop,
which appears to have intimated that no man under twenty-five
ought to be ordained. Williams explains in reply that he is
"nearer upwards of thirty than twenty-five," but avers, "I am
no elder in any church ... nor ever shall be, if the Lord please
to grant my desires that I may intend what I long after, the
natives souls." Williams's Letter, Narragansett Club Publications,
vi, 2. Of course, these words might have been written if
he had resigned the eldership before leaving Salem, but they
would have had much less pertinency.</p>

Massachusetts was under a government of congregations rather

of superiority as freely expressed at Hartford in 1639. There is a
quaint humor in what he says of it that is enhanced by the
naïve Dutch phrase in which it is set down: "Dit Volck gaven

Egyptenaren waren, end' Engelsen inde Vergienies waren mede

Cotton implicitly here, but without feeling sure that his
memory can ever be depended on where his polemical feeling is
concerned. On the next page he is guilty of a flagrant but no
doubt unconscious suppression of an important fact. "It pleased
the Lord to open the hearts of the Church to assist us," etc., he
says, putting out of sight the sharp dealing by which the Salem
church was brought to ignominious subjection.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b3_c2_11" name="anote_b3_c2_11"></a><a href="#note_b3_c2_11">Note 11, page 289.</a></span> Cotton's Answer to Williams, 29. Compare also Massachusetts
Records of 4th March, 1633, where a mercenary inducement
to take the oath is offered by making the regulations for recording
the lands of freemen apply also to the lands of "residents"
presumably not church members and ineligible to the franchise,
but only to the residents "that had taken or shall hereafter take
their oathes." Backus supposes that Williams saw some incidental
result from the oath that would be prejudicial to religious
freedom. This is to suppose that Williams needed a practical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>(p. 309)</span> consideration to stir him to action&mdash;it is to suppose that Williams
was not Williams. Practical men were afraid the independence
of Massachusetts would be lost; Roger Williams was
only afraid that Massachusetts would commit a public sin in
trying to escape the impending evil. A conscience undefiled
was his objective point in private and public life; safety, public
or private, was secondary.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b3_c2_12" name="anote_b3_c2_12"></a><a href="#note_b3_c2_12">Note 12, page 292.</a></span> There has been much ingenious and rather uncandid effort by
Cotton first of all, and by other defenders of the General Court
since, to prove that Williams's views on toleration were not a
cause of his banishment. If those views had been the sole cause,
the decree would have been more comprehensible and defensible
in view of the opinions of the age. But the question about the
validity of the patent, the question of the protest written against
the course of the magistrates in blackmailing Salem into a refusal to
support him, the question of the freeman's oath, and, what seems
to have been deemed of capital importance, the question of grace
after meat, are all involved at one time or another. The formal
charges in what may be considered the beginning of the banishment
proceedings, the trial in July, as given by Winthrop, our
most trustworthy authority, are: 1. That the magistrates ought
not to punish for a religious offense&mdash;"the breach of the first
table"&mdash;except where it disturbed the civil peace. 2. That the
magistrate ought not to tender an oath to an unregenerate man.
3. That a man ought not to pray with an unregenerate person.
4. That thanks were not to be given after the sacrament and after
meat. Savage's Winthrop, i, 193, 194. In the final proceedings
in October, the letters growing out of the refusal to confirm to
Salem its outlying land entered into and embittered the controversy.
Winthrop, i, 204. The recorded verdict makes the
divulging "of dyvers newe and dangerous opinions against the
aucthoritie of the magistrate" the first offense, and the "letter of
defamacion" the second. Williams says that a magistrate, who
appears to have been Haynes, the governor, summed up his
offenses at the conclusion of the trial under four heads: 1. The
denial of the authority of the patent. 2. The denial of the lawfulness
of requiring a wicked person to take an oath or pray. 3.
The denial of the lawfulness of hearing the parish ministers in
England. 4. The doctrine "that the Civill Magistrates' power
extends only to the Bodies and Goods and outward State of
men." Against the evidence of Williams, Winthrop, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>(p. 310)</span> records, I can not attach any importance to the halting accounts
given years afterward, for controversial purposes, by Cotton, from
what he thought was his memory.</p>

are Winthrop's Journal and the Massachusetts Records of the
period. Some facts can be gathered from the writings of Williams,
whose autobiographical passages always have an air of truth
while they are sometimes vague and often flushed by his enthusiastic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>(p. 311)</span> temper. Cotton's memory is less to be trusted; some of
his statements are in conflict with better authorities. He no
doubt believed himself to be truthful, but his ingenious mind was
unable to be precise without unconscious sophistication. Hubbard
was of Presbyterian tendencies and totally opposed to all
forms of Separatism. He appears to have recorded every exaggerated
rumor cherished by Williams's antagonists to his discredit.
Neither in this nor in other matters can we rely much on
Hubbard's testimony. No critical student of history puts unquestioning
confidence in Cotton Mather. His strange mind could
never utter truth unvarnished. In a case like this, where family
pride, local feeling, and sectarian prejudice were all on one
side, and where he had a chance to embroider upon traditions
already two generations old, it is better to disregard the author
of the Magnalia entirely. Bentley's Historical Account of Salem,
in 1st Massachusetts Historical Society Collections, vi, is a paper
that excites admiration for its broadmindedness. It contains information
not elsewhere to be found, but it is impossible to tell
how far Bentley depended upon sources not now accessible and
how far he relied on ingenious inferences drawn from his large
knowledge of local history. The publications of the Narragansett
Club contain the whole controversy between Cotton and
Williams and all the letters of the latter now known to be extant.
I have in some cases referred to the originals, in others I
have used these careful reprints. Williams has been rather fortunate
in his biographers. Mr. Oscar S. Straus, approaching the
subject from a fresh standpoint, has produced the latest Life of
Williams, written in a judicial temper and evincing a rare sympathy
with its subject. The character of Williams has never been
better drawn than by Mr. Straus, pp. 231-233. The life by T.
D. Knowles is perhaps the best of the older biographies, Arnold's
History of Rhode Island contains a sketch of Williams,
and Elton's brief biography has a value of its own. Gammell's
Life in Sparks's Biography is generally fair. "As to Roger Williams,"
by the late Dr. Henry Martyn Dexter, is, what it pretends
to be, a partisan statement of the case against Williams. It
shows characteristic thoroughness of research, it clears up many
minor points, and is as erudite as it is one-sided.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b3_c2_18" name="anote_b3_c2_18"></a><a href="#note_b3_c2_18">Note 18, page 298.</a></span> Baylie's Sermon before the House of Lords, on Errours and
Induration, accuses the Dutch of mere worldly policy in toleration.
Williams alludes to the charge, Bloudy Tenent yet more Bloudy,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>(p. 312)</span> p. 8. But the toleration of Holland may rather be traced to that
decay of bigotry and that widening of view which are beneficent
results of an extended trade. Williams in the Bloudy Tenent
yet more Bloudy, p. 10, complains of the exclusion of Catholics
and Arminians from toleration in the Netherlands. It would carry
us beyond the range of the present work to inquire how far the
toleration of Amsterdam was related to that "meridian glory"
which Antwerp reached as early as 1550 by making itself a place
of refuge for the persecuted of England, France, and Germany.
The Articles of Union, adopted at Utrecht in 1579, which have
been often called the Magna Charta of the Dutch, go to show
that political and commercial considerations counted in favor of
toleration, but they also show that some notion of the sacredness
of the free conscience had been adopted among the Dutch.
Article XIII of the Union provides that the states of Holland
and Zealand shall conduct their religious affairs as they think
good. More qualified arrangements are made for the other states,
as that they may restrict religious liberty as they shall find needful
for the repose and welfare of the country. But this significant
provision is added, that every man shall have freedom of private
belief without arrest or inquisition: "Midts dat een yder particulier
in syn Religie vry zal moghen blyven, ende dat men niemandt,
ter cause van de Religie, zal moghen achterhalen, ofte
ondersoecken." Pieter Paulus Verklaring der Unie van Utrecht,
i, 229, 230. Compare Van Meteren, Nederlandsche Historie etc.,
iii, 254, 255, and Hooft Nederlandsche Historie, etc., Book IX,
where the full text of Article XIII is given.</p>

Commonwealth, p. 97, cites Peter John Zwisck, a Mennonite of
West Frisia, as the author, in 1609, of The Liberty of Religion, in
which he maintains that men are not to be converted by force.
In 1614 one Leonard Busher petitioned James I in favor of liberty
of conscience, and Barclay conjectures that he was a member of
that Separatist or General Baptist church returned from Holland,
of which Helwyss had been pastor. In 1615 this obscure and
proscribed congregation professed a great truth, yet hidden from
the wise and prudent, namely, that "earthly authority belonged
to earthly kings, but spiritual authority belonged to that one
Spiritual king who is king of kings." In more than one matter
Roger Williams showed himself attracted to the doctrines of the
Mennonites and their offshoot the English General Baptist body.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>(p. 313)</span> Whether directly through his reading of Dutch theological works
or indirectly through English followers of Dutch writers, Williams
probably derived his broadest principles, in germ at least, from
the Mennonites or Anabaptists of the gentler sort, as he did also
some of his minor scruples. For the connection between the
Mennonites of the Continent and the English cognate sects the
reader is referred to Barclay's Inner Life, a valuable work of
much research. See also the petition of the Brownists, 1641,
cited in Barclay, p. 476, from British Museum, E 34-178, tenth
pamphlet.</p>

logic is his justification of the sentence of banishment against
Williams by citing Proverbs xi, 26: "He that withholdeth corn,
the people shall curse him." This text, says Cotton, "I alledged
to prove that the people had much more cause to separate such
from amongst them (whether by Civill or church-censure) as doe
withhold or separate them from the Ordinances or the Ordinances
from them, which are the bread of life." Reply to Williams's Examination,
40. The reference in the text is to the same work, 37.
"Much lesse to persecute him with the Civill Sword till it may
appeare, even by just and full conviction, that he sinneth not out
of conscience but against the very light of his own conscience."
But in Cotton's practice those who labored with the heretic were
judges of how much argument constituted "just and full conviction."
This logic would have amply sheltered the Spanish Inquisition.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b3_c2_21" name="anote_b3_c2_21"></a><a href="#note_b3_c2_21">Note 21, page 300.</a></span> Cotton's Answer to Williams's Examination, 38, 39. Cotton
confesses to having had further conversation of a nature unfavorable
to Williams, but he is able to deny that he counseled his
banishment. Even Cotton could hardly have prevented it, and
he confesses that he approved the sentence. The only interest
in the question is the exhibition of Cotton's habitual shrinking
from responsibility and his curious sinuosity of conscience.</p>

Public Library, which I have been kindly permitted to read, and
which is a treatise on the election sermons mostly existing only
in manuscript, the author says: "The early discourses were full
of ecclesiasticism, a great deal of theology, some politics; ... but
of humanity, brotherly kindness, and what we understand by
Christianity in the human relations, I have been able to discern
very little."</p>

scrupulosity was not. Cotton takes pains to call pulpits "scaffolds,"
to show that they had no sacredness. The scruple about
the heathen names of days of the week was felt by many other
Puritans. It is evident in Winthrop, and it did not wholly disappear
from Puritan use until about the end of the seventeenth
century.</p>

Chronica of 1536, from which it appears that the Seekers in fact
if not in name existed about a century before Williams adopted
their views. "Some desire to allow Baptism and other ceremonies
to remain in abeyance till God gives another command&mdash;sends
out true laborers into the harvest.... Some others agree
with those who think the ceremonies since the death of the
Apostles, are equally departed, laid waste and fallen&mdash;that God
no longer heeds them, and also does not desire that they should
be longer kept, on which account they will never again be set up
but now are to proceed entirely in Spirit and in Truth and now in
an outward manner." The relation of Seekerism to Quakerism
is manifest. "To be a Seeker is to be of the best Sect next to a
finder," wrote Cromwell in 1646.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>(p. 315)</span> CHAPTER THE THIRD.<br>
<span class="smcap"><i>NEW ENGLAND DISPERSIONS.</i></span></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Importance of the Rhode Island colony.</span> The removal of Roger Williams and his friends
was the beginning of dispersions from the mother
colony on Massachusetts Bay. The company that
settled Providence was too small in number at first
to be of great importance. The emigration of
Williams and his followers to the Narragansett
country was an example that may have turned the
scale with Hooker and his party in favor of a removal
to the Connecticut instead of to some place
in the Massachusetts wilderness. Williams certainly
prepared a harbor for most of the Hutchinsonians,
and pointed the way to Gortonists,
Baptists, Quakers, and all others of uneasy conscience.
Providence Plantation, and at times all
Rhode Island, fell into disorders inevitable in a
refuge for scruplers and enthusiasts established by
one whose energies were centrifugal and disintegrating.
But when at length it emerged from its
primordial chaos the community on Narragansett
Bay became of capital importance as an example
of the secularization of the state, and of the congruity
of the largest liberty in religion with civil
peace. The system which the more highly organized
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>(p. 316)</span> and orderly commonwealths of Massachusetts
and Connecticut labored so diligently to establish&mdash;a
state propping and defending orthodoxy and
church uniformity&mdash;was early cast into the rubbish
heap of the ages. The principle on which the
heterogeneous colony of religious outcasts on Narragansett
Bay founded itself, was stone rejected
that has become the head of the corner.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Connecticut migration.</span> The emigration to the Connecticut River was
already incubating when Williams sat down with
his radical seceders in the Narragansett woods.
The Connecticut settlement was impelled by more
various and complicated motives than that of Williams,
and its origins are not so easy to disentangle.
But it, too, has an epic interest; one dominant personality
overtops all others in this second of venturesome
westward migrations into the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Early life of Hooker.</span> We can trace nothing of Hooker to his birthplace,
a little hamlet in Leicestershire, except that
the imagery of his discourses in after life sometimes
reflected the processes of husbandry he had
known in childhood. But that he passed through
Emmanuel College, Cambridge, while Chaderton
was master, is more significant, for Emmanuel was
the cradle of Puritan divines, the hatching-place of
Puritan crotchets, the college whose chapel stood
north and south that it might have no sacred east
end, a chapel in which "riming psalms" were sung
instead of the hymns, and where lessons different

Hooker was presented to the living of Chelmsford,
in Essex. Here his eloquence attracted wide
attention, and unhappily attracted at the same time
the notice of his diocesan Laud, then Bishop of
London, who drove the preacher from his pulpit.
Hooker engaged in teaching a school four miles
from Chelmsford, where Eliot, afterward the Indian
apostle, became his usher and disciple. But
Laud had marked him as one to be brought low. <span class="sidenote">1630.</span>
He was cited before the Court of High Commission,
whose penalties he escaped by fleeing to Holland.
Thus early in his career Laud unwittingly
put in train events that resulted in the founding
of a second Puritan colony in New England.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hooker's company.</span> The persecution of Hooker made a great commotion
in Essex, dividing attention with the political
struggle between the king and the people about
tonnage and poundage. <span class="sidenote">Walker's First Church in Hartford, 40.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Dudley's Letter to Countess of Lincoln, Young's Chron.
of Mass., 320.</span> While Hooker was an
exile in Holland a company of people from Braintree
and other parts of Essex, near his old parish of
Chelmsford, emigrated to New England, chiefly,
one may suppose, for the sake of good gospel, since
they came hoping to tempt Hooker to become
their pastor. <span class="sidenote">Mass. Records, 14 June, 1631, and 3 February, 1632.</span>
This company settled at Newtown,
now Cambridge, which had been projected for a
fortified capital of the colony, that should be defensible
against Indians and out of reach if a sea
force should be sent from England to overthrow
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>(p. 318)</span> the government. <span class="sidenote">Holmes's Hist. Cambridge, 1st Mass. Hist. Coll., vii,
6-8.</span> Newtown was palisaded and
otherwise improved at the expense of the whole
colony. Hooker's company were perhaps ordered
to settle there because no place was appropriate to
the great divine but the new metropolis.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Failure of Newtown as a metropolis.</span> But a metropolis can not be made at will, as
many a new community has discovered. It had
been arranged that all the "assistants" or ruling
magistrates of Massachusetts should live within
the palisades of Newtown, but Winthrop, after the
frame of his house was erected, changed his mind
and took down the timbers, setting them up again
at Boston. <span class="sidenote">Savage's Winthrop, i, 98, 99. 1632.</span> This was the beginning of unhappiness
at Newtown, and the discontent had to do,
no doubt, with the rivalry between that place and
Boston. It is probable that there was a rise in the
value of Boston home lots about the time of the
removal of the governor's house. Trade runs in
the direction of the least resistance, and peninsular
Boston was destined by its situation to be the metropolis
of New England in spite of the forces that
worked for Salem and Newtown.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wonder-working Providence, ch. xxviii.</span> Newtown, or Cambridge, to call it by its later
name, was a long, narrow strip of land, "in forme
like a list cut off from the Broad-cloath" of Watertown
and Charlestown. <span class="sidenote">Wood's N. E. Prospect, 1634. Young, 402.</span> The village was compactly
built, as became an incipient metropolis, and
the houses were unusually good for a new country.
In one regard it was superior to Boston. No
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>(p. 319)</span> wooden chimneys or thatched roofs were allowed
in it. To this town came Hooker, and if it had continued
to be the capital, Hooker and not Cotton
might have become the leading spirit of the colony. <span class="sidenote">October, 1632.</span>
But a capital at a place to which only small vessels
could come up, was not practical, and the
magistrates in the year before Hooker's arrival
decided by general consent that Boston was the
fittest place in the bay for public meetings.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hooker's arrival, 1633.</span> The hopes of Newtown were perhaps not
wholly extinct for some time after. The arrival
of Hooker must have been a great encouragement
to the people. But Boston was on the alert. That
town had neither forest nor meadow land. Hay,
timber, and firewood were brought to its wharf in
boats. <span class="sidenote">Wood's N. E. Prospect.</span> From the absence of wood and marsh came
some advantages&mdash;it was plagued with neither mosquitoes
nor rattlesnakes, and what cattle there were
on the bare peninsula were safe from wolves. <span class="sidenote">Young, 397, 398.</span> Not
to be behind in evangelical attractions it secured
Cotton to balance Newtown's Hooker, when both
arrived in the same ship. That Boston was now
recognized as the natural metropolis was shown in
the abortive movement to pay a part of Cotton's
stipend by a levy on the whole colony.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Discontent at Newtown.</span> "Ground, wood, and medowe" were matters of
dispute between Newtown and its neighbors as
early as 1632, and the frequent references to questions
regarding the boundary of Newtown go to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>(p. 320)</span> show dissatisfaction in the discarded metropolis,
the number of whose people was out of proportion
to its resources. <span class="sidenote">Mass. Rec., <i>passim</i>.</span> Cattle were scarce in the colony.
Each head was worth about twenty-eight pounds,
the equivalent of several hundred dollars of money
in our time. <span class="sidenote">Wonder-working Providence, ch. xxxiii.</span> The Newtown people saw no prospect
of foreign trade, and found the plowable plains
of Cambridge dry and sandy. They had given
up trying to coax fortunes from the stony hill land
of the town with hand labor, and turned their attention
to the more profitable pursuit of cattle-raising.
They took unusual pains to protect their
valuable herd from the wolves by impaling a common
pasture. <span class="sidenote">Compare Holmes's History of Cambridge, 1 Mass. Hist.
Coll., vii, pp. 1, 2.</span> Natural meadow was the only resource
for hay in the English agriculture of the
seventeenth century, and the low grounds of Cambridge
yielded a poor grass. <span class="sidenote">2d Mass., vii, 127.</span> Shrewd men in Newtown
already saw that as an agricultural colony
Massachusetts was destined to failure, and one
Pratt, a surgeon there, was called to account for
having written to England that the commonwealth
was "builded on rocks, sands, and salt marshes."</p>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cotton and Hooker.</span> There is good authority for believing that a rivalry
between Hooker and Cotton had quite as much
to do with the discontent as straitened boundaries
and wiry marsh grass. Hooker was the greatest
debater, perhaps, in the ranks of the Puritans. His
theology was somewhat somber, his theory of
Christian experience of the most exigent type.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321"></a>(p. 321)</span> To be saved, according to Hooker, one must become
so passive as to be willing to be eternally
damned. <span class="sidenote">Compare Walker's First Church of Hartford, 129-132.</span> In other regards he was a Puritan of a
rather more primitive type than Cotton. He knew
no satisfactory evidence of a man's acceptance with
God but his good works. Cotton was less logical
but more attractive. His Puritanism grew in a garden
of spices. He delighted in allegorical interpretations
of the Canticles, his severe doctrines were
dulcified with sentiment, and his conception of the
inward Christian life was more joyous and mystical
and less legal and severe than Hooker's. He was
an adept in the windings of non-committal expression,
and his intellectual sinuosity was a resource
in debate or difficulty. Hooker, on the other hand,
had a downrightness not to be mistaken. With
an advantage in temperament and the additional
advantage of position in the commercial and political
center, it is not surprising that Cotton's
ideals eloquently and deftly presented soon dominated
the colony and that he became the Delphic
oracle whose utterances were awaited by the rulers
in emergencies.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Theological differences.</span> Theological differences were early apparent in
the teachings of the two leaders. Trivial enough
to the modern mind are these questions concerning
works as an evidence of justification and concerning
active and passive faith in justification. Hooker
maintained all by himself that there was "a
saving preparation in a Christian soule before unyon
with Christ."
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c3_1" name="note_b3_c3_1"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c3_1">Note 1.</a></span> The other ministers pretended
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>(p. 322)</span> to understand what he meant by this, and at first
opposed him unanimously. No doubt, too, Hooker
and his disciples found some fault with the outer
form of the church as shaped by Cotton. Certain
it is that Hooker's theories of civil government
were more liberal and modern than Cotton's,
though like Cotton's they were hung upon texts of
Scripture. Hooker lacked Cotton's superfluity of
ingenuity; he had less imagination and less poetic
sentiment than Cotton, but his intellect was more
rugged, practical, and virile. He was not a man
to have visions of a political paradise; he did not
attempt to limit citizenship to church members
when he framed a constitution for the Connecticut
towns. Nor did he give so much power and privilege
to the magistrate as was given in Massachusetts.
<span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c3_2" name="note_b3_c3_2"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c3_2">Note 2.</a></span>
He disapproved of Cotton's aristocratic theory
of the permanence of the magistrate's office, as
he did apparently of the negative vote of the upper
house and of the arbitrary decisions which the Massachusetts
magistrates assumed the right to make.</p>

<h4>VII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Attractions of Connecticut.</span> One other potent motive there was. Stories of
the fertility of the "intervale" land on the Connecticut
River came by the mouth of every daring
adventurer who had sailed or tramped so far.
There one might find pasture for the priceless
cattle and hay to last the long winter through, and
in that valley one might cultivate plains of great
fertility.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>(p. 323)</span> VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obstacles to removal.</span> There were dangerous Pequots on the Connecticut,
it is true, and the Dutch had already
planted a trading house and laid claim to the territory.
The Plymouth people who traded there
were also claimants. And, more than all, leaving
Massachusetts in a time of danger from the machinations
of Laud would seem desertion. The government
of the Massachusetts Bay colony was
anomalous; it partook of the character of the commercial
company from which it sprang, yet it had
traits of a religious or at least a voluntary society.
It was the accepted opinion that those who had
taken the freeman's oath were "knit" together
"in one body," and that none of them ought to
leave the colony without permission. Hooker's
party gained the consent of a majority of the representative
members of the General Court, but not
of a majority of the assistants. <span class="sidenote">Savage's Winthrop, i, 167, 168.</span> This precipitated
a debate in the colony on the constitutional question
of the right of the assistants, or magistrates, to
form an upper house and veto a decision of the
chosen deputies of the towns.</p>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Attempts to prevent removal.</span> It is no part of our purpose to unravel the tangle
of ecclesiastical and civil politics in which the
proposed emigration had now become involved.
The Dorchester church and a part of that of Watertown
were ready to follow the lead of Hooker and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324"></a>(p. 324)</span> Newtown. Days of fasting and prayer were appointed
to prevent the removal of these "candlesticks,"
as the churches were called, out of their
places; but in spite of humiliations and of Cotton's
persuasive eloquence, which at one time almost
charmed away the discontent, the emigration set
in, stragglingly at first.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Explorers and pioneers.</span> John Oldham, an adventurous man of a rather
lawless temper&mdash;one of those half-ruffians that are
most serviceable on an Indian frontier&mdash;had been
expelled from Plymouth. <span class="sidenote">1633.</span> He was now a resident
of Watertown, one of the centers of discontent and
next neighbor to Newtown. He had gone with
three others on a trading expedition to the westward
overland. Walking along trails from one
Indian village to another they discovered a large
river, which they found to be the Fresh River of
the Dutch and the Connecticut of the Plymouth
traders. They probably brought back to Watertown
accounts that produced a fever for removal.
Oldham was not a man to stand on the manner of
his emigration. Waiting for nobody's consent, he
led out a small company from Watertown the next
year. These settled at what is now Wethersfield.
From Dorchester, which had no alewife fishery
with which to enrich its fields, settlers removed in
1634 to the Connecticut, where the soil did not
need to be "fished." In 1635 the number of emigrants
was larger, and there was much suffering
during the following winter and many of the cattle
perished.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>(p. 325)</span> X.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Emigration by churches.</span> But the unit of New England migration was the
church. No doubt the cohesiveness of the townships,
and of the churches which were the nuclei of
the towns, was re-enforced by provincial differences
between the several communities. <span class="sidenote">1636.</span> In 1636 Hooker,
the real founder of Connecticut, and his congregation
of Essex people, sold their houses and meadows
and home lots and acre rights in the commonage
in Cambridge to a new congregation led
by Thomas Shepard. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c3_3" name="note_b3_c3_3"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c3_3">Note 3.</a></span> From Newtown and from
Dorchester the churches emigrated bodily&mdash;pastors,
teachers, ruling elders, and deacons&mdash;carrying
their organization with them through the wilderness
like an ark of the covenant. New churches
were soon afterward formed in the places they
had left. Naturally, town government became the
principal feature of civil organization in states thus
planted by separate and coherent groups.</p>

<h4>XI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The new government.</span> The Connecticut rulers acted at first as a government
subordinate to Massachusetts; but the settlements,
except that of people from Roxbury at
Springfield, were south of the line of the Massachusetts
colony, and it was not in the nature of
things that Hooker and Haynes should subordinate
themselves to Cotton and Winthrop. There was
indeed no little exasperation between the two colonies.
An independent constitution was adopted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>(p. 326)</span> in Connecticut, on principles which Hooker thought
he found in the first chapter of Deuteronomy, and
which were not exactly those that Cotton had managed
to deduce from Scripture in his Model of
Moses his Judicials. <span class="sidenote">Conn. Hist. Soc. Coll., i, 20, 21.</span> The Massachusetts people,
whose government aspired to dominate all New
England, seem to have been angered by Hooker's
secession and by his refusal to subordinate the new
state to their own. Massachusetts asserted its authority
over Springfield, which was within its limits,
and every effort possible was made to prevent
new emigrants who landed at Boston from going
to the west. <span class="sidenote">Conn. Hist. Soc. Coll., i, 3, and ff.</span> Even in England accounts adverse to
Connecticut were circulated. Hooker, the real
head of the new state, resented this in a letter of
great vigor and some passion.</p>

<h4>XII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Instability of a theocracy.</span> In its early years Massachusetts had no rest.
Three profound disturbances&mdash;the expulsion of
Williams, the secession of Hooker and his followers,
and the Hutchinsonian convulsion&mdash;followed
one another in breathless succession, and a dangerous
Indian war ran its course at the same time.
That the early settlements were founded on
"rocks and sands and salt marshes" was not the
chief misfortune of the Bay colony. Its ecclesiastical
politics proved explosive, to the consternation
of its pious founders, who like other settlers
in Utopia had neglected to reckon with human
nature.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>(p. 327)</span> XIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Severity of Puritanism.</span> It has been the habit of modern writers on the
subject to dismiss the Hutchinsonian controversy
as a debate about meaningless propositions in an
incomprehensible jargon. Yet there was in it but
the action of well-known tendencies in human nature
which might almost have been predicted from
the antecedent circumstances. Puritanism had
wrapped itself in the haircloth of austerity, it took
grim delight in harsh forbiddings, and heaped up
whole decalogues of thou-shalt-nots. Nor did it
offer, as other intense religious movements have
done, the compensation of internal joys for the
gayety it repressed. Theoretically Calvinist, it was
practically an ascetic system of external duties and
abstentions, trampling on the human spirit without
ruth.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Reaction toward a subjective joyousness.</span> But the heart will not be perpetually repressed;
kept from natural pleasures, it will seek supernatural
delights. Men were certain sooner or later to
soften the iron rigidity of Puritanism by cultivating
those subjective joys for which Calvinism provided
abundant materials. While preachers like Hooker
were scourging the soul into a self-abasement that
could approve its own damnation, and while ingenious
scribes were amassing additional burdens
of scruple for heavy-laden shoulders, there arose in
England a new school of Puritan pietists. These
shirked none of the requirements of the legalists,
but their spirits sought the sunnier nooks of Calvinism,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>(p. 328)</span> and they preached the joy of the elect and the
delight of a fully assured faith. <span class="sidenote">Magnalia B. III, c. I, 32.</span> Cotton, whose fair
complexion, brown hair, and ruddy countenance
attested a sanguine temperament, belonged by nature
to this new order. <span class="sidenote">Compare Cotton's Fountain of Life, 35.</span> He rejoiced that he had
received the "witness of the Spirit" on his wedding
day, and he delighted to draw out Scripture imagery
to a surprising tenuity in describing the
"covenant of marriage" and the intimacy of the
"covenant of salt" or of friendship between God
and the soul of the believer. Preachers of the
same sort brought relief to multitudes in various
towns of England. The people, tired of churchly
routine on the one hand and of legalism on the
other, thronged to hear such divines "filling the
doores and windows." It was the evangelicalism
of the following century sending up its shoots
prematurely into a frosty air. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c3_4" name="note_b3_c3_4"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c3_4">Note 4.</a></span> The old-fashioned
Puritan had always conceived of religion as difficult
of attainment. It was a paradoxical system
wherein men were saved by the works they theoretically
abjured. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c3_5" name="note_b3_c3_5"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c3_5">Note 5.</a></span> Conservative Puritans complained
of the preachers who spread a table of
"dainties," as though it were meritorious to sustain
the soul on a rugged diet of rough doctrine. <span class="sidenote">Shepard's Memoirs in Young, 505.</span> In
Thomas Shepard's Memoirs of his own Life we
may overhear "a godly company" of the time in
familiar "discourse about the wrath of God and the
terror of it, and how intolerable it was; which they
did present by fire, how intolerable the torment of
that was for a time; what, then, would eternity be?"</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>(p. 329)</span> XIV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cotton's revivalism.</span> Cotton professed that he loved to sweeten his
mouth with a piece of Calvin before he went to
sleep. <span class="sidenote">Winthrop's Journal, i, 144.</span> His emotional rendering of Calvinistic doctrines
wrought strongly on the people of the new
Boston, and his advent was followed by widespread
religious excitement. More people were admitted
to the church in Boston in the earlier months of
Cotton's residence than to all the other churches in
the colony. <span class="sidenote">Report of Record Com. ii, 5. Boston Town Records, 1635.
Hutchinson Papers, p. 88.</span> Boston seems to have become religious
in a pervasive way, and in 1635 measures were
taken to prevent persons who were not likely to
unite with the church from settling in the town.
In this community, which had no intellectual interest
but religion, and from which ordinary diversions
were banished, there were sermons on
Sunday and religious lectures on week days and
ever-recurring meetings in private houses. The
religious pressure was raised to the danger point,
and an explosion of some sort was well-nigh inevitable.
Cotton's enthusiasms were modulated by
the soft stop of a naturally placid temper, but
when communicated to others they were more dangerous.</p>


<h4>XV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mrs. Hutchinson's character.</span> Mrs. Anne Hutchinson had been one of Cotton's
ardent disciples in old Boston. She crossed the
sea with her husband that she might sit under
his ministry in New England. She was a woman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>(p. 330)</span> cursed with a natural gift for leadership in an age
that had no place for such women. <span class="sidenote">Wonder-working Providence, ch. lxii.</span> "This Masterpiece
of Womens wit," the railing Captain Johnson
calls her, and certainly her answers before the Massachusetts
General Court go to show that she was
not inferior in cleverness to any of the magistrates
or ministers. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c3_6" name="note_b3_c3_6"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c3_6">Note 6.</a></span> Winthrop, whose antipathy to her
was a passion, speaks of her "sober and profitable
carriage," and says that she was "very helpful in
the time of childbirth and other occasions of bodily
infirmities, and well furnished with means to those
purposes." <span class="sidenote">Short Story, etc., p. 31.</span> In the state of medical science at that
time such intelligent and voluntary ministration
from a "gentlewoman" must have been highly valued.
Almost alone of the religionists of her time
she translated her devotion into philanthropic exertion.
But a woman of her "nimble and active wit"
could not pass her life in bodily ministrations.
Power seeks expression, and her native eloquence
was sure to find opportunity. <span class="sidenote">Cotton's The Way of the Churches Cleared, Part I, p.
51. Short Story, 31.</span> Mrs. Hutchinson
made use of the usual gathering of gossips on the
occasion of childbirth to persuade the women to
that more intimate religious life of which she was
an advocate. It was the custom to hold devotion
at concert pitch by meetings at private houses for
men only; women might be edified by their husbands
at home. Mrs. Hutchinson ventured to open
a little meeting for women. <span class="sidenote">Short Story, 34.</span> This was highly approved
at first, and grew to unexpected dimensions;
fifty, and sometimes eighty, of the principal women
of the little town were present at her conferences.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331"></a>(p. 331)</span> XVI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mrs. Hutchinson's doctrines.</span> In these meetings she emphasized Cotton's favorite
doctrine of "a covenant of grace." Her sensitive
woman's nature no doubt had beat its wings
against the bars of legalism. <span class="sidenote">Compare Whelewright's Sermon in Proc. Mass. Hist. Soc.,
1866, 265. Cotton's Sermon on the Churches Resurrection, 1642.</span> She was not a philosopher,
but nothing could be more truly in accord
with the philosophy of character than her desire to
give to conduct a greater spontaneity. Cotton himself
preached in the same vein. In addition to the
Reformation, of which Puritans made so much, he
looked for something more which he called, in the
phrase of the Apocalypse, "the first resurrection."
Mrs. Hutchinson, who was less prudent and more
virile than Cotton, did not hesitate to describe
most of the ministers in the colony as halting under
a "covenant of works." Her doctrine was, at bottom,
an insurrection against the vexatious legalism
of Puritanism. She carried her rebellion so far
that she would not even admit that good works
were a necessary evidence of conversion. It was
the particular imbecility of the age that thought of
almost every sort must spin a cocoon of theological
phrases for itself. Spontaneity of religious
and moral action represented itself to Mrs. Hutchinson
and her followers as an indwelling of the
Holy Ghost in the believer and as a personal union
with Christ whom they identified with the "new
creature" of Paul. Such a hardening of metaphor
into dogma is one of the commonest phenomena
of religious thought.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>(p. 332)</span> XVII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Vane's arrival, 1635.</span> Sir Henry Vane the younger, who had become
an ardent Puritan in spite of his father, landed in
Boston in October, 1635. He had already shown
those gifts which enabled him afterward to play a
considerable part in English history. <span class="sidenote">His election as governor, 1636.</span> His high
connections made him an interesting figure, and
though only about twenty-six years of age he was
chosen governor in May, 1636. Ardent by nature,
and yet in his youth when he "forsook the honors
and preferments of the court to enjoy the ordinances
of Christ in their purity," nothing was more
natural than that he should be captivated by the
seraphic Cotton and that he should easily adopt
the transcendental views of Mrs. Hutchinson.
Winthrop, the natural leader of the colony, having
given place in 1635 to Haynes, perhaps in order
that Hooker's party might be conciliated and the
Connecticut emigration avoided, was a second time
thrust aside that a high-born youth might be honored.
Winthrop was utterly opposed to Mrs.
Hutchinson, in whose teachings his apprehensive
spirit saw full-fledged Antinomianism, and, by inference,
potential anabaptism, blasphemy, and sedition.
The Hutchinsonians were partisans of Vane,
who adhered to their doctrine. The ministers other
than Cotton and Whelewright, stung by the imputation
that they were under "a covenant of works,"
rallied about Winthrop. Political cleavage and religious
division unfortunately coincided.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>(p. 333)</span> XVIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arrogance of the Hutchinson party.</span> Supported by the prestige of the young governor
and of some conspicuous citizens and inspired
by Cotton's metaphorical and mystical preaching,
which was interpreted with latitude, the enthusiasm
of the Hutchinsonians tended to become fanaticism.
We have to depend mainly on the prejudiced
account of their enemies, but there is little
reason to doubt that the advocates of "a covenant
of grace" assumed the airs of superiority usually
seen in those who have discovered a short cut to
perfection. The human spirit knows few greater
consolations than well-disguised self-righteousness.
The followers of Mrs. Hutchinson, if we may believe
the witnesses, sometimes showed their sanctity
by walking out of meeting when a preacher not
under "a covenant of grace" entered the pulpit.
They even interrupted the services with controversial
questions addressed to the minister. Wilson,
pastor of the Boston church, was condemned by
them as being under "a covenant of works," and
also incidentally criticised for his "thick utterance."
Nor can one find that Cotton interposed
his authority to protect his less gifted colleague.
It is quite conceivable that he looked with some
satisfaction on the progress of affairs in Boston. <span class="sidenote">1636.</span>
The heavenly minded young governor who had
chosen to suffer reproach with the people of God
was his disciple. The brilliant woman who was
easily the leader of the town was the very apostle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span> of his doctrine. The superiority of his opinions
on a union with Christ that preceded active faith
as compared with those of Hooker and the lesser
divines was enthusiastically asserted by the great
majority of the Boston church, led by Mrs. Hutchinson.
Seeing so much zeal and sound doctrine he
may have felt that the first or spiritual resurrection
of which he was wont to prophesy from the Apocalypse,
had already begun in his own congregation,
and that among these enthusiasts were those who
had learned to "buy so as though they bought
not"&mdash;those who had been lifted into a crystalline
sphere where they had "the Moone under their
feet. <span class="sidenote">Cotton's Churches Resurrection, p. 27.</span> And if we have the Moone under our feete,
then wee are not eclipsed when the Moone is
Eclipsed." Thus did Cotton's imagination revel
in cosmical imagery.</p>

<h4>XIX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bitterness of the debate.</span> The arrogance of the elect is hard to bear, and
it is not wonderful that the debate waxed hot.
The concentrated religiousness of a town that
sought to shut out unbelieving residents made the
dispute dangerous. In the rising tempest a ballast
of ungodly people might have been serviceable.
But in Boston there were few even of the indifferent
to be buffers in the religious collision. While
the covenant-of-grace people made themselves offensive,
their opponents,&mdash;Winthrop, the slighted
ex-governor, Wilson, the unpopular pastor, and the
ministers accused of being under a covenant of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>(p. 335)</span> works&mdash;resorted to the favorite weapons of polemics.
They hatched a brood of inferences from
the opinions Mrs. Hutchinson held, or was thought
to hold, and then made her responsible for the
ugly bantlings. They pretended to believe, and
no doubt did believe, that Mrs. Hutchinson's esoteric
teaching was worse than what she gave out.
They borrowed the names of ancient heresies, long
damned by common consent, to give odium to her
doctrine. That the new party should be called Antinomian
was plausible; the road they had chosen
for escape from Puritan legalism certainly lay in
that direction. But Antinomianism had suffered
from an imputation of immorality, and no such
tendency was apparent, unless by logical deduction,
in the doctrines taught in Boston. The hearers
of Mrs. Hutchinson were also accused of having
accepted the doctrines of the so-called Family
of Love which had of old been accused of many
detestable things, and was a common bugaboo of
theology at the time. The whole town of Boston
and the whole colony of Massachusetts was set in
commotion by the rude theological brawl. <span class="sidenote">Overthrow of Vane, 1637.</span> Such
was the state of combustion in Boston that it was
thought necessary by the opponents of Vane and
Mrs. Hutchinson to hold the court of elections at
the former capital, Newtown. The excitement at
this court was so great that the church members,
who only could vote, were on the point of laying
violent hands on one another in a contest growing
out of a question relating to the indwelling of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>(p. 336)</span> Holy Ghost. Vane was defeated, and Winthrop
again made governor.</p>

<h4>XX.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Synod of 1637.</span> A great synod of elders from all the New England
churches was assembled. All the way from
Ipswich and Newbury on the east and from the
Connecticut on the west the "teaching elders"
made their way by water or by land, at public expense,
that they might help the magistrates of Massachusetts
to decide on what they should compel
the churches to believe. <span class="sidenote">Short Story of the Rise, Reign, etc., <i>passim</i>.</span> For more than three
weeks the synod at Cambridge wrestled with the
most abstruse points of doctrine. <span class="sidenote">Winthrop's Journal, i, 284, and following.</span> The governor
frequently had to interpose to keep the peace;
sometimes he adjourned the assembly, to give time
for heats to cool. <span class="sidenote">Cotton's Way of the Churches Cleared, <i>passim</i>.</span> A long list of errors, most of
which were not held by anybody in particular,
were condemned. A nearly unanimous conclusion
on certain fine-spun doctrines was reached at length
by means of affirmations couched in language
vague or ambiguous. Cotton, who had been forced
after debate to recant one opinion and modify
others, assented to the inconclusive conclusions,
but with characteristic non-committalism he qualified
his assent and withheld his signature.</p>

<h4>XXI.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">The persecution.</span> The field was now cleared for the orderly persecution
of the dissentients. Whelewright, Mrs.
Hutchinson's brother-in-law, had been convicted of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>(p. 337)</span> sedition in the preceding March on account of an
imprudent sermon preached on a fast day. But his
sentence had been deferred from court to court, apparently
until after the synod. <span class="sidenote">Mass. Rec., i, 207.</span> At the November
court following the synod Whelewright was banished,
and those who had signed a rather vigorous
petition in his favor many long months before were
arraigned and banished or otherwise punished.
The banished included some of the most intelligent
and conspicuous residents. Not until this November
court had her opponents ventured to bring
Mrs. Hutchinson to trial. Whelewright, standing
by his hot-headed sermon, had just been sentenced;
the abler but more timid Cotton had already been
overborne and driven into a safe ambiguity by the
tremendous pressure of the great synod. Vane
had left the colony, and the time was ripe to finish
the work of extirpation. The elders were summoned
to be present and advise.</p>

<h4>XXII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mrs. Hutchinson's trial, 1637.</span> During a two days' trial, conducted inquisitorially,
like an English Court of High Commission,
Cambridge presented the spectacle of a high-spirited
and gifted woman, at the worst but a victim
of enthusiasm, badgered by the court and by the
ministers, whose dominant order she had attacked. <span class="sidenote">Hutchinson's Hist. of Mass. Bay, ii, appendix.</span>
Cotton, with more than his usual courage, stood
her defender. The tough-fibered Hugh Peter, who
made himself conspicuous in several ways, took it
on him to rebuke Cotton for saying a word in defense
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>(p. 338)</span> of the accused. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c3_7" name="note_b3_c3_7"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c3_7">Note 7.</a></span> Endecott and Hugh Peter,
mates well matched, browbeat the witnesses who
appeared in Mrs. Hutchinson's behalf, and Dudley,
the conscientious advocate of persecution, was
rude and overbearing. Winthrop acted as chief
inquisitor, the narrow sincerity and superstition of
his nature obscuring the nobler qualities of the
man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutchinson defended herself adroitly at
first, refusing to be trapped into self-condemnation.
But her natural part was that of an outspoken agitator,
and her religious exaltation had been increased,
doubtless, by persecution, for combativeness
is a stimulant even to zeal. On the second
day she threw away "the fear of man," and declared
that she had an inward assurance of her deliverance,
adding that the General Court would
suffer disaster. For this prophesying she was
promptly condemned. Cotton had prophesied
notably on one occasion, Wilson, his colleague, was
given to rhyming prophecies, and Hooker had
made a solemn prediction while in Holland. In
this very year the plan of the Pequot campaign had
been radically changed in compliance with a revelation
vouchsafed to the chaplain, Stone. But these
were ministers, and never was the ministerial office
so reverenced as by the Puritans, who professed to
strip it of every outward attribute of priestliness.
Above all, for a woman to teach and to have
revelations was to stand the world on its head.
"We do not mean to discourse with those of your
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>(p. 339)</span> sex," etc., said Winthrop severely to Mrs. Hutchinson
during the trial. <span class="sidenote">Mrs. Hutchinson is excommunicated.</span> She was sentenced to banishment,
but reprieved, that the church might deal
with her. On the persuasion of Cotton and others,
Mrs. Hutchinson wrote a recantation apologizing
for her assumption to have revelations, and retracting
certain opinions of which she had been accused.
But she added that she had never intended to
teach or to hold these opinions. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c3_8" name="note_b3_c3_8"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c3_8">Note 8.</a></span> For this falsehood,
as it was deemed, she was summarily excommunicated.
Yet nothing seems more probable than
that her hyperbolic utterances under excitement
had not stood for dogmatic opinions. <span class="sidenote">Rise, Reign, Ruine, etc., and Winthrop's Journal, i,
309, 310.</span> Under Cotton's
fine-spun system of church government a
member could not be excommunicated except by
unanimous consent. Many of Mrs. Hutchinson's
friends were absent from the colony, others had
prudently changed sides or stayed away from the
meeting. But her sons ventured to speak in her
behalf. Cotton at once admonished them. The
effect of putting them under admonition was to disfranchise
them; it was one of Cotton's ingenuities
of the sanctuary. The sons out of the way, the
mother was cast out unanimously&mdash;a punishment
much dreaded among the Puritans, who believed
that what was thus bound on earth was bound in
heaven. It was a ban that forbade the faithful
even to eat with her. But the melancholy under
which Mrs. Hutchinson had suffered vanished at
once, and she said as she left the church assembly,
"Better to be cast out than to deny Christ."</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>(p. 340)</span> XXIII.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Omens and auguries.</span> Mrs. Hutchinson and most of her party settled
on Rhode Island, where they sheltered themselves
at first in caves dug in the ground. Here she
again attracted attention by the charm of her eloquent
teaching, and some came from afar to hear
the "she Gamaliel," as her opponents called her.
Such gifts in a woman, and in one who had been
excommunicated by the authority vested in the
church, could be accounted for only by attributing
her power to sorcery. <span class="sidenote">Savage's Winthrop's Journal, i, 313, 316; ii, 11, and
Short Story of Rise and Reign of Antinomianism.</span> Winthrop sets down the
evidence that she was a witch, which consisted in
her frequent association with Jane Hawkins, the
midwife, who sold oil of mandrakes to cure barrenness,
and who was known to be familiar with
the devil. At length "God stepped in," and by
his "casting voice" proved which side was right.
Mary Dyer, one of the women who followed Mrs.
Hutchinson, had given birth to a deformed stillborn
child. <span class="sidenote">Winthrop, i, 316.</span> This fact became known when Mrs.
Dyer left the church with the excommunicated
Mrs. Hutchinson. Winthrop had the monstrosity
exhumed after long burial had rendered its traits
difficult to distinguish. He examined it personally
with little result, but he published in England
incredible midwife's tales about it. God stepped
in once more, and Mrs. Hutchinson herself, after
she went to Rhode Island, suffered a maternal misfortune
of another kind. The wild reports that
were circulated regarding this event are not fit to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>(p. 341)</span> be printed even in a note; the first editor of Winthrop's
journal felt obliged to render the words
into Latin in order that scholars might read them
shamefacedly. <span class="sidenote">Savage's Winthrop, i, 326.</span> But Cotton, who was by this time
redeeming himself by a belated zeal against the
banished sectaries, repeated the impossible tale,
which was far worse than pathological, to men and
women, callow youths, young maidens, and innocent
children "in the open assembly at Boston on
a lecture day," explaining the divine intent to signalize
her error in denying inherent righteousness.
The governor, who was more cautious, wrote to
the physician and got a correct report, from which
the divine purpose was not so evident, and Cotton
made a retraction at the next lecture. We are
now peering into the abyss of seventeenth-century
credulity. <span class="sidenote">Death of Mrs. Hutchinson.</span> Here are a grave ruler and a divine
once eminent at the university, and now
renowned in England and in America, wallowing
in a squalid superstition in comparison with which
the divination of a Roman haruspex is dignified.</p>

<p>Having suffered the loss of her husband, and
hearing of efforts on the part of Massachusetts to
annex Rhode Island, Mrs. Hutchinson removed to
the Dutch colony of New Netherland with her
family. <span class="sidenote"><a id="note_b3_c3_9" name="note_b3_c3_9"></a><a href="#anote_b3_c3_9">Note 9.</a></span> Here she and all her household except
one child were massacred by the Indians. This
act of Providence was hailed as a final refutation
of her errors, the more striking that the place
where she suffered was not far removed from a
place called Hell Gate.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>(p. 342)</span> XXIV.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Results of ecclesiastical government.</span> This famous controversy lets in much light upon
the character of the age and the nature of Puritanism.
It is one of many incidents that reveal the
impracticability of the religious Utopia attempted
in New England. The concentration of religious
people undoubtedly produced a community free
from the kind of disorders that are otherwise inseparable
from a pioneer state and that were found
abundantly in New Netherland, in Maryland, and in
Virginia and on the eastward fishing coast. "These
English live soberly," said a Dutch visitor to Hartford
in 1639, "drinking but three times at a meal,
and when a man drinks to drunkenness they tie
him to a post and whip him as they do thieves in
Holland." But while some of the good results to
be looked for in an exclusively Puritan community
were attained, it was at the cost of exaggerating
the tendency to debate and fanaticism and developing
the severity, the intolerance, and the meddlesome
petty tyranny that inheres in an ecclesiastical
system of government. During the lifetime of one
generation Massachusetts suffered all these, and it is
doubtful whether regularity of morals was not purchased
at too great a sacrifice of liberty, bodily and
spiritual, and of justice. Certainly the student of
history views with relief the gradual relaxation
that came after the English Restoration and the
disappearance from the scene of the latest survivors
of the first generation of New England leaders.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The New Haven colony.</span> During the period of the greatest excitement
over the Hutchinson case John Davenport, a noted
Puritan minister of London, had been in Massachusetts.
Like many other emigrant divines of the
time he brought a migrant parish with him seeking
a place to settle. Davenport arrived in June,
1637, and took part against the Antinomians in
the synod. After examining every place offered
them in Massachusetts, he and his friends refused
all and resolved to plant a new colony. The people
were Londoners and bent on trade, and Massachusetts
had no suitable place for their settlement
left. The bitterness of the Hutchinson controversy
may have had influence in bringing them to
this decision, and the preparations of Laud to subject
and control Massachusetts perhaps had weight
in driving them to seek a remoter settlement.
Davenport had ideals of his own, and the earthly
paradise he sought to found was not quite Cotton's
nor was it Hooker's. He and his followers planted
the New Haven colony in 1638. In this little colony
church and state were more completely blended
than in Massachusetts. The government was by
church members only, to the discontent of other
residents, and in 1644 New Haven adopted the
laws of Moses in all their rigor. The colony was
united with Connecticut by royal charter at the
Restoration, after which the saints no longer sat
upon thrones judging the tribes of Israel.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>(p. 344)</span> CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Later English emigrations to New England.</span> The emigration to New England from the
mother country was quickened by the troubles
that preceded the civil war. In 1638 it reached
its greatest height, having been augmented perhaps
by agricultural distress. Fourteen ships
bound for New England lay in the Thames at one
time in the spring of that year. There was alarm
at the great quantity of corn required for the
emigrants, lest there should not be enough left
in London to last till harvest. "Divers clothiers
of great trading" resolved to "go suddenly," in
which we may see, perhaps, evidence of bad times
in the commercial world. Some parishes it was
thought would be impoverished. <span class="sidenote">Lord Maynard to Laud, 17 March, 1638, in Sainsbury.</span> Laud was asked

was busy trying to compel the Scots to use the

were favorable to New England; the customs officers
purposely neglected to search for contraband
goods, and the ships, twenty in all, got away with
or without license, and brought three thousand
passengers to Boston. <span class="sidenote">Rushworth, i, Part II, 409, 718.</span> But the tide spent itself
about this time, and by 1640 emigration to the
New England colonies had entirely ceased. <span class="sidenote">Josselyn's Rarities, 108.</span> About
twenty-one thousand two hundred people had been
landed in all.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cavalier emigration to Virginia.</span> The swing of the political pendulum in England
that served to check the Puritan exodus gave impetus
to a new emigration to Virginia and Maryland.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>(p. 345)</span> During the ten years and more before 1640
few had gone to that region but bond servants.
There were in that year not quite eight thousand
people in Virginia. It is the point of time at which
the native Virginians began to rear a second generation
born on the soil. <span class="sidenote">Petition to House of Lords, 15 Aug., 1648. Royal Hist.

the king sent to the colony in the following years
a large cavalier emigration, and the average character
of the colonists was raised. Better ministers
held the Virginia parishes and better order was
observed in the courts. <span class="sidenote">Sainsbury, 360.</span> In 1648 four hundred
emigrants lay aboard ships bound for Virginia at
one time, and in 1651 sixteen hundred royalist prisoners
seem to have been sent in one detachment.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prospective ascendency of the English colonies.</span> By the middle of the seventeenth century the
English on the North American continent were in
a fair way to predominate all other Europeans.
From the rather lawless little fishing villages on
the coast of Maine to the rigorous Puritan communes
of the New Haven colony that stretched
westward to pre-empt, in advance of the Dutch,
land on the shores of Long Island Sound, the English
held New England. English settlers "seeking
larger accommodations" had crossed to Long Island
and were even pushing into the Dutch colony.
The whole Chesapeake region was securely English.
Already there were Virginians about to
break into the Carolina country lying wild between
Virginia and the Spanish colony in Florida. The
French and the Dutch and the Spaniards excelled
the English in far-reaching explorations and adventurous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>(p. 346)</span> fur-trading. But the English had proved
their superior aptitude for planting compact agricultural
communities. A sedentary and farming
population where the supply of land is not limited
reaches the highest rate of natural increase. At a
later time, Franklin estimated that the population
of the colonies doubled every twenty-five years
without including immigrants. The compactness
of English settlement and the prolific increase of
English people decided the fate of North America.
The rather thin shell of Dutch occupation was already,
by the middle of the seventeenth century,
feeling the pressure under stress of which it was
soon to give way. A century later collision with
the populous and ever-multiplying English settlements
brought about the collapse of the expanded
bubble of New France.</p>

indorsed by Archbishop Laud, "Rec: Octob: 7. 1637," "Propositions
wch have devided Mr. Hooker &amp; Mr. Cotton in Newe
England. 1. That a man may prove his justification by his works
of sanctification, as the first, best, and only cheife evidence of his
salvation. 2. Whither fayth be active or passive in justification.
3. Whither there be any saving preparation in a Christian soule
before his unyon with Christ. This latter is only Hooker's opinion,
the rest of the ministers do not concurr with him: Cotton and
the rest of the contrary opinion are against him and his party in
all." Colonial Papers, ix, 71. In the next paper in the same
volume, also indorsed by Laud, the controversy is more fully set
forth. Copies of both are in the Bancroft collection of the New
York Public Library. Laud indorsed these papers respectively
October 7 and 15, 1637. The Cambridge Synod, which met August
30th, had adjourned late in September, and the debates
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>(p. 347)</span> which divided the two divines must have preceded it, and perhaps
preceded the migration of Hooker to Connecticut in 1636. When
Haynes was Governor of Massachusetts he had pronounced the
sentence of banishment against Williams. But some years later,
while Governor of Connecticut, he relented a little and wrote to
Williams: "I think, Mr. Williams, I must now confesse to you,
that the most wise God hath provided and cut out this part of
his world for a refuge and receptacle for all sorts of consciences.
I am now under a cloud, and my brother Hooker, with the bay, as
you have been, we have removed from them thus far, and yet they
are not satisfied." Quoted by Williams in a letter to Mason, 1st
Massachusetts Historical Collections, i, 280.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b3_c3_2" name="anote_b3_c3_2"></a><a href="#note_b3_c3_2">Note 2, page 322.</a></span> The abstract of Hooker's sermon of May 31, 1638, as deciphered
and published by Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, is in the
Collections of the Connecticut Historical Society, i, 20, 21, and
the Fundamental Laws of 1639 are in Hinman's Antiquities, 20,
and ff., and in Trumbull's Blue Laws, 51. Compare also the
remarkable letter of Hooker to Winthrop in Connecticut Historical
Society Collections, i, 3-15. Hooker objects strongly
to the right of arbitrary decisions by the magistrate: "I must
confess, I ever looked at it as a way which leads directly to
tyranny, and so to confusion, and must plainly profess, if it was
in my liberty, I would choose neither to live nor leave my posterity
under such government." This letter exhibits Hooker's intellect
to great advantage. One is inclined to rank him above
most of his New England contemporaries in clearness and breadth
of thought.</p>

older settlers was of constant occurrence in all the colonies during
the colonial period. It was a notable practice on the frontiers
of Pennsylvania down to the Revolution, and perhaps later. Hubbard
thus describes what went on in every New England settlement:
"Thus the first planters in every township, having the
advantage of the first discovery of places, removed themselves
into new dwellings, thereby making room for others to succeed
them in their old." General History of New England, 155.</p>

in favor of toleration beginning to prevail there. Nine years
after he had obtruded himself so eagerly to testify against Mrs.
Hutchinson, he was writing to New England earnest remonstrances
against persecution. 4 Massachusetts Historical Collections,

<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b3_c3_8" name="anote_b3_c3_8"></a><a href="#note_b3_c3_8">Note 8, page 338.</a></span> There were those who wished to give time for a second admonition
before excommunication, but they were overruled, probably
by Wilson. Winthrop, i, 310. It would, perhaps, have
been in better form to take the other and less eager course.
There is a Latin paper in the British Public Record Office, dated
3 March, 1635, which professes to give a brief and orderly digest
of the canons of government constituted and observed in the reformed
New England churches. I am unable to trace its authority.
From this I quote; "Qui pertinacitur consistorii admonitiones
rejecerit a c&oelig;na domini suspendatur. Si suspensus, post
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349"></a>(p. 349)</span> iteratus admonitiones nulla p&oelig;nitentiæ signum dederit ad excomunicationem
procedat Ecclesia."</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><a id="anote_b3_c3_9" name="anote_b3_c3_9"></a><a href="#note_b3_c3_9">Note 9, page 341.</a></span> It would be a waste of time to controvert the ingenious apologies
which have been written to prove that an inexorable necessity
compelled the banishment of the Antinomians. The Massachusetts
government was in its very nature and theory opposed to
religious toleration, as we may see by the reference of the case of
Gorton and his companions to the elders, and their verdict that
these men, not residents of the jurisdiction, ought to be put to
death for constructive blasphemy, a decision that the magistrates
by a majority vote would have put in execution if the
"deputies" or representative members of the assembly had not
dissented. Savage's Winthrop's Journal, ii, 177. The doctrine
of intolerance is ingeniously set forth in Cotton's "The Powring
Ovt of the Seven Vials, ... very fit and necessary for this Present
Age," published in 1642. Cotton compares Jesuits and heretics
to wolves, and says, "Is it not an acceptable service to the
whole Country to cut off the ravening Wolves?" The Puritans
of New England from their very circumstances were slower to
accept the doctrine of religious liberty than their coreligionists in
England.</p>

<p class="book"><i><span class="min2em">WITH THE FATHERS.</span> Studies in the History of
the United States.</i> By <span class="smcap">John Bach McMaster</span>, Professor of
American History in the University of Pennsylvania, author of
"The History of the People of the United States," etc. 8vo.
Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<div class="review">
<p>"The book is of great practical value, as many of the essays throw a broad
light over living questions of the day. Prof. McMaster has a clear, simple
style that is delightful. His facts are gathered with great care, and admirably
interwoven to impress the subject under discussion upon the mind of the
reader."&mdash;<i>Chicago Inter-Ocean.</i></p>

<p>"Prof. McMaster's essays possess in their diversity a breadth which covers
most of the topics which are current as well as historical, and each is so scholarly
in treatment and profound in judgment that the importance of their place
in the library of political history can not be gainsaid."&mdash;<i>Washington Times.</i></p>

<p>"Such works as this serve to elucidate history and make more attractive a

<p class="center">THE STORY OF THE WEST SERIES.</p>

<p class="center">Edited by Ripley Hitchcock.</p>

<p class="review">"There is a vast extent of territory lying between the Missouri River and the Pacific
coast which has barely been skimmed over so far. That the conditions of life
therein are undergoing changes little short of marvelous will be understood when one
recalls the fact that the first white male child born in Kansas is still living there; and
Kansas is by no means one of the newer States. Revolutionary indeed has been the
upturning of the old condition of affairs, and little remains thereof, and less will remain
as each year goes by, until presently there will be only tradition of the Sioux
and Comanches, the cowboy life, the wild horse, and the antelope. Histories, many
of them, have been written about the Western country alluded to, but most if not
practically all by outsiders who knew not personally that life of kaleidoscopic allurement.
But ere it shall have vanished forever we are likely to have truthful, complete,
and charming portrayals of it produced by men who actually knew the life and have
the power to describe it."&mdash;<i>Henry Edward Rood, in the Mail and Express.</i></p>

<div class="review">
<p>"In every way worthy of an author who, as an authority upon the Western Indians,
is second to none. A book full of color, abounding in observation, and remarkable
in sustained interest, it is at the same time characterized by a grace of style
which is rarely to be looked for in such a work, and which adds not a little to the
charm of it"&mdash;<i>London Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"Only an author qualified by personal experience could offer us a profitable study
of a race so alien from our own as is the Indian in thought, feeling, and culture. Only
long association with Indians can enable a white man measurably to comprehend
their thoughts and enter into their feelings. Such association has been Mr. Grinnell's."&mdash;<i>New

Shinn</span>. Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p class="review">The figures of the prospector and the miner are clearly outlined in the course
of the romantic story of that mine which more than any other embodies the
romance, the vicissitudes, the triumphs, the excitement, and the science of
mining life&mdash;the Great Comstock Lode. From the prospector, through development
and deep-mining, to the last of the stock gambling, the story is told in
a way that presents a singularly vivid and engrossing picture of a life which
has played so large a part in the development of the remoter West.</p>

<div class="review">
<p>"The most sumptuous and elaborate work which has yet appeared on this theme....
The book should be in every well-equipped Oriental library, as the most complete
work on the dawn of civilization. Its careful reading and studying will open a
world of thought to any diligent student, and very largely broaden and enlarge his
views of the grandeur, the stability, and the positive contributions of the civilization
of that early day to the life and culture of our own
times."&mdash;<i>Chicago Standard.</i></p>

<p>"By all odds the best account of Egyptian and Assyrian theology, or more properly

<p>"A lucid sketch, at once popular and learned, of daily life in Egypt at the time of
Rameses II, and of Assyria in that of Assurbanipal.... As an Orientalist, M. Maspero
stands in the front rank, and his learning is so well digested and so admirably
subdued to the service of popular exposition, that it nowhere overwhelms and always
interests the reader."&mdash;<i>London Times.</i></p>

<p>"Only a writer who had distinguished himself as a student of Egyptian and Assyrian
antiquities could have produced this work, which has none of the features of a
modern book of travels in the East, but is an attempt to deal with ancient life as if
one had been a contemporary with the people whose civilization and social usages are
very largely restored."&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

from 1775 to 1894. By <span class="smcap">Edgar Stanton Maclay</span>, A. M. With
Technical Revision by Lieut. <span class="smcap">Roy C. Smith</span>, U. S. N. In two volumes.
With numerous Maps, Diagrams, and Illustrations. 8vo. Cloth,
$7.00.</p>

<div class="review">
<p>"The field is comparatively new, and Mr. Maclay has brought to his task patience,
assiduity, and patriotism.... Maps and plans, and a great number of illustrations,
add value to the book, which is designed to be a permanent and useful contribution to
historical literature."&mdash;<i>New York Observer.</i></p>

<p>"While the author has had the assistance of Lieut. Roy C. Smith, U. S. N., in
preparing those parts of his work which are necessarily technical, he has wisely refrained
from confusing the general reader by an undue parade of technicalities....
The narrative proceeds in a clear, concise, and vigorous style, which very materially
adds to the character of the work."&mdash;<i>New York Journal of Commerce.</i></p>

<p>"The author writes as one who has digged deep before he began to write at all.
He thus appears as a master of his material. This book inspires immediate confidence
as well as interest."&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>"A most conscientious narrative, from which wise statesmen may learn much for
their guidance, and it certainly is one of absorbing interest."&mdash;<i>New York Commercial
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Maclay is specially qualified for the work he has undertaken. Nine years
has he devoted to the task. The result of his labors possesses not only readableness
but authority.... Mr. Maclay's story may be truthfully characterized as a thrilling
romance, which will interest every mind that is fed by tales of heroism, and will be read
with patriotic pride by every true American."&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>"A more valuable and important work of history than this has not been issued from
the press for many a day. It is not only that this book tells a story never before told
(for Cooper's works never professed to tell the whole story of our navy, even down to
his own day), but that it is told with true historic sense, and with the finest critical acumen."&mdash;<i>New
York Evangelist.</i></p>

<p>"A work which is destined to fill a noticeable gap in our national annals."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>"No better excuse for this important work could be desired than that a navy with
such a brilliant career on the whole as has the American navy is without a full and continuous
record of its achievement.... The author has important new facts to tell,
and he tells them in a clear and graceful literary style."&mdash;<i>Hartford Post.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Maclay has deservedly won for himself an enviable place among our American
historians.... His researches have been exhaustive and his inquiries persistent,
and he has used his wealth of material with a proper appreciation of historical value."&mdash;<i>Boston
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"Like the average young American, this author has an enthusiastic appreciation of
American valor on the high seas, and he reproduces graphic sketches of battle scenes
and incidents in a way to insure for his book a hearty welcome on the part of these
who keenly enjoy this sort of literature.... The illustrations of the old battle ships
and the conflicts at sea, made memorable as long as the history of the American
Republic shall live, add much to the attractiveness of this book.... Professor Maclay
has added a substantial work to historical American literature."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>"It fills a place which has almost escaped the attention of historians. Mr. Maclay's
work shows on every page the minute care with which he worked up his theme. His
style is precise and clear, and without any pretense of rhetorical embellishment."&mdash;<i>New
York Tribune.</i></p>

<p class="review">In this work the publishers offer something which is not furnished by histories
or encyclopædias, namely, a succinct but comprehensive expert account
of our country at the present day. The very extent of America and American
industries renders it difficult to appreciate the true meaning of the United
States of America. In this work the American citizen can survey the land upon
which he lives, and the industrial, social, political, and other environments of
himself and his fellow-citizens. The best knowledge and the best efforts of
experts, editor, and publishers have gone to the preparation of a standard book
dedicated to the America of the present day; and the publishers believe that
these efforts will be appreciated by those who desire to inform themselves
regarding the America of the end of the century.</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
